By using HTTP, REST APIs can fully utilize the internet infrastructure, which greatly reduce the complexity and operational costs. For example, using HTTPS for transport security, and using URL for request routing.\n\nJSON is a simple, stable, and intuitive data format , which is not expected to change ever. This offers great ease of use and stability to REST APIs. For high performance applications, binary formats can be used instead, such as protobuf or thrift.\n\nREST APIs are often designed as CRUD APIs, where API operations are commonly expressed as Create, Retrieve, Update, and Delete operations on resources. CRUD operations are naturally mapped to HTTP methods (POST, GET, PUT/PATCH, and DELETE), and API resources can be naturally identified using URLs."}]}

To shift between one of the engaged gears, typically marked 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 N (for neutral) and R (for reverse), press down on the clutch all the way to the floor and move the shifter to the desired location. Once the car is on and you're in neutral if you want to move forward, press and hold the clutch pedal to the floor and move the shifter to the \"1\" position. Slowly disengage the clutch pedal partially, and while disengaging slowly start to press down on the gas pedal. After gradually pressing more on the gas pedal, slowly remove your foot from the clutch entirely. This will start you in forward motion, and you will be restricted to the speed limit of 1st gear.

This began an accretion of provinces and territories and a process of increasing autonomy from the United Kingdom, highlighted by the Statute of Westminster, 1931, and culminating in the Canada Act 1982, which severed the vestiges of legal dependence on the Parliament of the United Kingdom.\n\nCanada is a parliamentary liberal democracy and a constitutional monarchy in the Westminster tradition. The country's head of government is the prime minister, who holds office by virtue of their ability to command the confidence of the elected House of Commons and is \"called upon\" by the governor general, representing the monarch of Canada, the head of state. The country is a Commonwealth realm and is officially bilingual (English and French) in the federal jurisdiction. It is very highly ranked in international measurements of government transparency, quality of life, economic competitiveness, innovation, and education. It is one of the world's most ethnically diverse and multicultural nations, the product of large-scale immigration. Canada's long and complex relationship with the United States has had a significant impact on its history, economy, and culture.\n\nA highly developed country, Canada has one of the highest nominal per capita income globally and its advanced economy ranks among the largest in the world, relying chiefly upon its abundant natural resources and well-developed international trade networks. Canada is part of several major international and intergovernmental institutions or groupings including the United Nations, NATO, G7, Group of Ten, G20, Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD), World Trade Organization (WTO), Commonwealth of Nations, Arctic Council, Organisation internationale de la Francophonie, Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation forum, and Organization of American States."}]}

Rubber-tipped pinchers means you will not need to bend or stretch too far to reach, and you will be surprised how much of a difference this makes to your community members!\n- Fishing: most fishing can be done from the banks of a river or lake, and is a great way to experience the calming effects of a body of water while still being physically active. Whether fly fishing or reel fishing, many people who have entered retirement find this an engaging way to engage with nature either solo or as part of a community of fisher-people."}]}

First played during the 1871\u201372 season, it is the oldest national football competition in the world. It is organised by and named after The Football Association (The FA). Since 2015, it has been known as The Emirates FA Cup after its headline sponsor. A concurrent Women's FA Cup has been held since 1970.\n\nThe competition is open to all eligible clubs down to Level 9 of the English football league system with Level 10 clubs acting as stand-ins in the event of non-entries from above. Included in the competition are 20 professional clubs in the Premier League (level 1), 72 professional clubs in the English Football League (levels 2 to 4), and all clubs in steps 1\u20135 of the National League System (levels 5 to 9) as well as a tiny number of step 6 clubs acting as stand-ins for non-entries above. A record 763 clubs competed in 2011\u201312. The tournament consists of 12 randomly drawn rounds followed by the semi-finals and the final. Entrants are not seeded, although a system of byes based on league level ensures higher ranked teams enter in later rounds \u2013 the minimum number of games needed to win, depending on which round a team enters the competition, ranges from six to fourteen.\n\nThe first six rounds are the Qualifying Competition, from which 32 teams progress to the first round of the Competition Proper, meeting the first of the 48 professional teams from Leagues One and Two. The last entrants are the Premier League and Championship clubs, into the draw for the Third Round Proper. In the modern era, only one non-League team has ever reached the quarter-finals, and teams below Level 2 have never reached the final. As a result, significant focus is given to the smaller teams who progress furthest, especially if they achieve an unlikely \"giant-killing\" victory.\n\nWinners receive the FA Cup trophy, of which there have been two designs and five actual cups; the latest is a 2014 replica of the second design, introduced in 1911. Winners also qualify for the UEFA Europa League and a place in the upcoming FA Community Shield. Arsenal are the most successful club with fourteen titles and Ars\u00e8ne Wenger is the most successful manager in the history of the competition, having won seven finals as Arsenal's manager.\n\nLiverpool are the current holders, having beaten Chelsea 6\u20135 on penalties following a 0\u20130 draw in the 2022 final."}]}

This is done by quietening the mind of all the random thoughts that are being continuously generated, and having the senses alerted to the signals that are being passed in the moment.  The signals are the sensations or emotions or sounds that one is feeling and hearing in the present moment.  To accomplish this, the breath serves as an anchor to the present moment.  Being aware of one's breath keeps us in the present moment.  When the mind eventually wanders, the breath is a signal to tune back into the present moment.

In lead climbing the rope begins at the bottom attached to the climber as well as the belayer. The climber must then bring the rope from the bottom of the route to the top by clipping into a series of quick draws that are generally placed 10-15 feet apart. If a person were to fall while lead climbing, they would be caught by the last quick draw they clipped into. When top rope climbing, the rope is already at the top of the route. This means the climber must tie into one side of the rope while their belayer must clip into the other side of the rope. As the climber ascends higher up the route the belayer must take out the slack of the rope as opposed to lead climbing where the belayer would be giving slack. When a person falls in top rope climbing they will only fall a short distance as the rope is already clipped in above them at the top of the route, so how far they fall will be determined by how much slack the belayer has not taken in."}]}

The park caters to high-paying guests who may indulge their wildest fantasies within the park without fear of retaliation from the hosts, who are prevented by their programming from harming humans. Later on, the series' setting expands to the real world, in the mid-21st century, where people's lives are driven and controlled by a powerful artificial intelligence named Rehoboam.\n\nNolan and Joy served as showrunners. The second, third and fourth season followed in April 2018, March 2020, and June 2022, respectively. Nolan and Joy planned a fifth and final season, and were in negotiations with HBO to produce it. However, in November 2022, it was announced that HBO had canceled the series. The series was removed from HBO Max on December 18, 2022.\n\nWestworld's debut on HBO had the network's highest viewership ratings for a premiere since the first episode of True Detective, in 2014. Westworld's first season is the most-watched first season of any HBO original series. The first season also received critical acclaim and was highly praised for its performances, visuals, narrative, themes and soundtrack from Ramin Djawadi. Reception of the series declined from the second season onwards, with the scripts, characterization and narrative opacity being targeted for criticism; viewership ratings also diminished throughout its run. It has received numerous accolades, winning nine Primetime Emmy Awards out of 54 nominations.

The aim was to simplify and provide a single interface across all NPCI systems, thereby creating interoperability and a superior customer experience.\n\nUPI is now one of the most preferred payment solutions in India, with over a billion transactions every month. FY22, the total transaction value processed by the United Payments Interface (UPI) platform accounted for 86% of India\u2019s GDP. UPI\u2019s core function is to support easy and secure money transfers between bank accounts. It does this by adding multiple bank accounts into a single mobile application, allowing for seamless fund transfers and merchant payments from one place. It also enables \u2018peer to peer\u2019 and \u2018peer to merchant\u2019 collection requests, which can be scheduled and paid as requested.\n\nPayments can be made using a UPI ID, UPI Number, Account number, and an Indian Financial System Code (IFSC). Payment security is as per applicable Reserve Bank of India (RBI) guidelines using a 1-click 2-factor authentication where the second factor of authentication is the UPI PIN. \n\nUPI can be accessed on all major platforms such as Android and iOS with apps developed by members for versions of Android 4.2.2 and iOS 8.1 and above.\n\nThe primary business uses of UPI are to allow a personal mobile as the primary device for all payments, including person to person, person to entity, and entity to person. Using a personal mobile an individual can \u2018Pay\u2019 someone (push) as well as \u2018Collect\u2019 from\nsomeone (pull). In addition, the ability to pay and collect using \u2018UPI IDs\u2019 that are \u2018aliases\u2019 to the VPA. The goal is to make  payments by providing an address without having to ever provide account details or credentials on third party applications or websites.\nAlso, sending \u2018collect\u2019 requests to others (person to person or entity to person) with a\u2018pay by\u2019 date, which allows customers to pay at a later date without blocking the money in the account. UPI also allows for pre-authorizing multiple recurring payments (utilities, school fees, subscriptions, etc.) with a one-time secure authentication and rule-based access, similar to ECS. UPI autopay allows customers to set recurring payments for their UPI transactions. Recurring payments up to Indian Rupees 2000 can be set at the frequency desired.\n\nThis makes payments using UPI a fully interoperable system across all PSPs without having silos and closed systems with one-click two-factor authentication, using a personal\nphone, and without any acquiring devices or physical tokens.\n\nIn March 2023, Reserve Bank of India (RBI) and the Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS) launched the linkage of UPI and Singapore\u2019s PayNow. Remittances from Singapore to India were on track to breach the $100 billion mark in 2023, making it the fourth highest remitting nation to India, accounting for 5.7% of all inbound remittances. Integrating PayNow and UPI will likely reduce charges and the time taken for such transactions."}]}

Such measures often cannot capture the true statistical features of the risk and return which often follow highly skewed distributions (e.g. the\u00a0[log-normal distribution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Log-normal_distribution)) and can give rise to, besides reduced\u00a0(https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Volatility_(finance)), also inflated growth of return.\u00a0In practice, investors must substitute predictions based on historical measurements of asset return and volatility for these values in the equations. Very often such expected values fail to take account of new circumstances that did not exist when the historical data were generated.\n\nMore fundamentally, investors are stuck with estimating key parameters from past market data because MPT attempts to model risk in terms of the likelihood of losses, but says nothing about why those losses might occur. The risk measurements used are\u00a0(https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Probability)\u00a0in nature, not structural. This is a major difference as compared to many engineering approaches to\u00a0[risk management](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk_management).\n\nMathematical risk measurements are also useful only to the degree that they reflect investors' true concerns\u2014there is no point minimizing a variable that nobody cares about in practice. In particular,\u00a0(https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Variance)\u00a0is a symmetric measure that counts abnormally high returns as just as risky as abnormally low returns. The psychological phenomenon of\u00a0[loss aversion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Loss_aversion)\u00a0is the idea that investors are more concerned about losses than gains, meaning that our intuitive concept of risk is fundamentally asymmetric in nature. There many other risk measures (like\u00a0[coherent risk measures](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coherent_risk_measure)) might better reflect investors' true preferences.\n\nModern portfolio theory has also been criticized because it assumes that returns follow a\u00a0[Gaussian distribution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Normal_distribution). Already in the 1960s,\u00a0[Benoit Mandelbrot](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benoit_Mandelbrot)\u00a0and\u00a0[Eugene Fama](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eugene_Fama)\u00a0showed the inadequacy of this assumption and proposed the use of more general\u00a0[stable distributions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stable_distributions)\u00a0instead.\u00a0[Stefan Mittnik](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stefan_Mittnik)\u00a0and\u00a0[Svetlozar Rachev](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Svetlozar_Rachev)\u00a0presented strategies for deriving optimal portfolios in such settings.\n\n[Contrarian investors](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Contrarian_investing)\u00a0and\u00a0[value investors](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Value_investing) typically do not subscribe to Modern Portfolio Theory.\u00a0One objection is that the MPT relies on the\u00a0[efficient-market hypothesis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Efficient-market_hypothesis)\n\u00a0and uses fluctuations in share price as a substitute for risk.\u00a0[Sir John Templeton](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sir_John_Templeton)\n\u00a0believed in diversification as a concept, but also felt the theoretical foundations of MPT were questionable, and concluded (as described by a biographer): \"the notion that building portfolios on the basis of unreliable and irrelevant statistical inputs, such as historical volatility, was doomed to failure.\n\n"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "- The risk, return, and correlation measures used by Modern portfolio theory (MPT) are based on\u00a0expected values, such expected values fail to take account of new circumstances that did not exist when the historical data were generated\n- The risk measurements used in MPT are\u00a0probabilistic because MPT models risk in terms of the likelihood of losses based on past market data and not why the losses occur.\n- MPT attempts to minimize risks in the form of variance.

Does there exist another shape?\n\n"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Not all planets and moons are round. There is some variety in their shapes depending on their masses, and curiously looking worlds might even exist, unlike anything we know from our system.\n\nEverything within a planet or a moon is under the influence of gravity in such a way that bits of it would move to the center if they could. Under ideal conditions, it would acquire a spherical shape. For objects made of something other than liquids, it varies at what point they become round. It is generally assumed that they mostly become spheres around 400 kilometers/248 miles in diameter when made from icy material commonly found in our Solar System. Still, if something is made from something more rigid, it needs to be larger in diameter than that - around 750 km/466 miles. At a sufficient mass, even rock becomes fluid-like. The moon of Mars Deimos is only 12.6 km/7.8 miles across and is not spherical, and there are many other small moons of other planets that don\u2019t have a round shape.\n\nThis, however, is not all. Astronomical objects spin, giving them the flattened shape of a sphere the faster their rotation if they are massive enough. On top of it, they can have moons. This causes a bulge to form at the position of their orbiting body around them. In the case of Earth, our Moon causes tides via this process. Also, our Sun gives our planet tides. Elsewhere in the Universe, there could be planets with massive moons or two similarly massive planets, called double planets, orbiting their common center of mass, the barycenter, at a close distance, which can cause even stronger bulging. Their shape would be affected this way more visibly.\n\nFinally, a bizarre, toroidal planet, shown above, can be stable from what we know from physics, at least for a while. As I mentioned earlier, even rigid rock behaves like a fluid at large masses. An adequate rotation speed can counterbalance the strength of gravity with centrifugal acceleration, and a torus-shaped planet could exist. A possible scenario for such a world to come to be would be if two sufficiently fast rotating planets collided and formed a doughnut of vaporized rock, a so-called synestia.\n\nWe currently think that the events that would lead to the formation of a world of this shape are so unlikely that there might not be a single toroidal planet in the Visible Universe, but we were quite a few times surprised by what we discovered during our exploration of Cosmos. Perhaps we will even find a doughnut shape world one day."}]}

A spokesman for the Nation of Islam until 1964, he was a vocal advocate for Black empowerment and the promotion of Islam within the Black community. A posthumous autobiography, on which he collaborated with Alex Haley, was published in 1965.\n\nMalcolm spent his adolescence living in a series of foster homes or with relatives after his father's death and his mother's hospitalization. He committed various crimes, being sentenced to 10 years in prison in 1946 for larceny and burglary. In prison he joined the Nation of Islam (adopting the name Malcolm X to symbolize his unknown African ancestral surname while discarding \"the White slavemaster name of 'Little'\"), and after his parole in 1952 quickly became one of the organization's most influential leaders. He was the public face of the organization for 12 years, advocating Black empowerment and separation of Black and White Americans, and criticizing Martin Luther King Jr. and the mainstream civil rights movement for its emphasis on nonviolence and racial integration. Malcolm X also expressed pride in some of the Nation's social welfare achievements, such as its free drug rehabilitation program. From the 1950s onward, Malcolm X was subjected to surveillance by the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI).\n\nIn the 1960s, Malcolm X began to grow disillusioned with the Nation of Islam, as well as with its leader, Elijah Muhammad. He subsequently embraced Sunni Islam and the civil rights movement after completing the Hajj to Mecca, and became known as \"el-Hajj Malik el-Shabazz,\" which roughly translates to \"The Pilgrim Malcolm the Patriarch\". After a brief period of travel across Africa, he publicly renounced the Nation of Islam and founded the Islamic Muslim Mosque, Inc. (MMI) and the Pan-African Organization of Afro-American Unity (OAAU). Throughout 1964, his conflict with the Nation of Islam intensified, and he was repeatedly sent death threats. On February 21, 1965, he was assassinated in New York City. Three Nation members were charged with the murder and given indeterminate life sentences; in 2021, two of the convictions were vacated. Speculation about the assassination and whether it was conceived or aided by leading or additional members of the Nation, or with law enforcement agencies, has persisted for decades.\n\nA controversial figure accused of preaching racism and violence, Malcolm X is also a widely celebrated figure within African-American and Muslim American communities for his pursuit of racial justice. He was posthumously honored with Malcolm X Day, on which he is commemorated in various cities across the United States. Hundreds of streets and schools in the U.S. have been renamed in his honor, while the Audubon Ballroom, the site of his assassination, was partly redeveloped in 2005 to accommodate the Malcolm X and Dr. Betty Shabazz Memorial and Educational Center."}]}

When the highest point in the long-period wave reaches a shoreline the area experiences high tide. When the lowest point of the wave, the trough, reaches shore the area experiences low tide. The earth is mostly water and the water \"points\" at the moon, the parts of the Earth experiencing high tide is the water drawing towards the moon. The \"pointing\" water that faces the moon is formed because the gravitational pull of the moon is strongest on whichever side of the Earth faces it. Gravity pulls the ocean towards the moon and high tide occurs.\n\nThe bulge on the far side of the Earth is caused by inertia. The water moving away from the moon resists the gravitational forces that attempt to pull it in the opposite direction. Because the gravitational pull of the moon is weaker on the far side of the Earth, inertia wins, the ocean bulges out and high tide occurs. As the Earth spins, different areas of the planet face the moon, and this rotation causes the tides to cycle around the planet."}]}

It began when the United States declared war on 18 June 1812. Although peace terms were agreed upon in the December 1814 Treaty of Ghent, the war did not officially end until the peace treaty was ratified by Congress on 17 February 1815.\n\nTensions originated in long-standing differences over territorial expansion in North America and British support for Native American tribes who opposed U.S. colonial settlement in the Northwest Territory. These escalated in 1807 after the Royal Navy began enforcing tighter restrictions on American trade with France and press-ganged men they claimed as British subjects, even those with American citizenship certificates. Opinion in the U.S. was split on how to respond, and although majorities in both the House and Senate voted for war, they divided along strict party lines, with the Democratic-Republican Party in favour and the Federalist Party against. News of British concessions made in an attempt to avoid war did not reach the U.S. until late July, by which time the conflict was already underway.\nAt sea, the far larger Royal Navy imposed an effective blockade on U.S. maritime trade, while between 1812 to 1814 British regulars and colonial militia defeated a series of American attacks on Upper Canada. This was balanced by the US winning control of the Northwest Territory with victories at Lake Erie and the Thames in 1813. The abdication of Napoleon in early 1814 allowed the British to send additional troops to North America and the Royal Navy to reinforce their blockade, crippling the American economy. In August 1814, negotiations began in Ghent, with both sides wanting peace; the British economy had been severely impacted by the trade embargo, while the Federalists convened the Hartford Convention in December to formalise their opposition to the war.\n\nIn August 1814, British troops burned Washington, before American victories at Baltimore and Plattsburgh in September ended fighting in the north. Fighting continued in the Southeastern United States, where in late 1813 a civil war had broken out between a Creek faction supported by Spanish and British traders and those backed by the U.S. Supported by U.S. militia under General Andrew Jackson, the U.S.-backed Creeks won a series of victories, culminating in the capture of Pensacola in November 1814. In early 1815, Jackson defeated a British attack on New Orleans, catapulting him to national celebrity and later victory in the 1828 United States presidential election. News of this success arrived in Washington at the same time as that of the signing of the Treaty of Ghent, which essentially restored the position to that prevailing before the war. While Britain insisted this included lands belonging to their Native American allies prior to 1811, as Congress did not recognize them as independent nations, the Americans did not comply with these provisions and the British made no effort to compel them to do so. The Native Americans were subsequently pushed west of the Mississippi River."}]}

This is where the common confusion surrounds European Football and American Football. American Football, created much later than European Football, is played with a pig skin with a prolate shape on a grass turf surface, much like European Football. In American Football, instead of using their feet, players use their hands to pass the ball to one another through the air or hand the ball off to one another and attempt to run into the opponent's endzone. When European Football eventually came to the United States, the moniker soccer remained with the sport.

{"dataset": "alpagasus_3k_dolly", "id": "alpagasus_3k_177", "messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Given this article about Operation Aurora, which companies were targeted in the attacks?\nOperation Aurora was a series of cyber attacks conducted by advanced persistent threats such as the Elderwood Group based in Beijing, China, with ties to the People's Liberation Army. First publicly disclosed by Google on January 12, 2010, in a blog post, the attacks began in mid-2009 and continued through December 2009.\n\nThe attack was aimed at dozens of other organizations, of which Adobe Systems, Akamai Technologies, Juniper Networks, and Rackspace have publicly confirmed that they were targeted. According to media reports, Yahoo, Symantec, Northrop Grumman, Morgan Stanley, and Dow Chemical were also among the targets.\n\nAs a result of the attack, Google stated in its blog that it plans to operate a completely uncensored version of its search engine in China \"within the law, if at all,\" and acknowledged that if this is not possible, it may leave China and close its Chinese offices. Official Chinese sources claimed this was part of a strategy developed by the U.S. government.\n\nThe attack was named \"Operation Aurora\" by Dmitri Alperovitch, Vice President of Threat Research at cybersecurity company McAfee. Research by McAfee Labs discovered that \"Aurora\" was part of the file path on the attacker's machine that was included in two of the malware binaries McAfee said were associated with the attack. \"We believe the name was the internal name the attacker(s) gave to this operation,\" McAfee Chief Technology Officer George Kurtz said in a blog post.\n\nAccording to McAfee, the primary goal of the attack was to gain access to and potentially modify source code repositories at these high-tech, security, and defense contractor companies. \"[The SCMs] were wide open,\" says Alperovitch. \"No one ever thought about securing them, yet these were the crown jewels of most of these companies in many ways\u2014much more valuable than any financial or personally identifiable data that they may have and spend so much time and effort protecting.\"\n\nHistory\n\nFlowers left outside Google China's headquarters after its announcement it might leave the country\nOn January 12, 2010, Google revealed on its blog that it had been the victim of a cyber attack. The company said the attack occurred in mid-December and originated from China. Google stated that over 20 other companies had been attacked; other sources have since cited that more than 34 organizations were targeted. As a result of the attack, Google said it was reviewing its business in China. On the same day, United States Secretary of State Hillary Clinton issued a brief statement condemning the attacks and requesting a response from China.\n\nOn January 13, 2010, the news agency All Headline News reported that the United States Congress plans to investigate Google's allegations that the Chinese government used the company's service to spy on human rights activists.\n\nIn Beijing, visitors left flowers outside of Google's office. However, these were later removed, with a Chinese security guard stating that this was an \"illegal flower tribute\". The Chinese government has yet to issue a formal response, although an anonymous official stated that China was seeking more information on Google's intentions.\n\nAttackers involved\nFurther information: Cyberwarfare by China\nTechnical evidence including IP addresses, domain names, malware signatures, and other factors, show Elderwood was behind the Operation Aurora attack. The \"Elderwood\" group was named by Symantec (after a source-code variable used by the attackers), and is referred to as the \"Beijing Group\" by Dell Secureworks. The group obtained some of Google's source code, as well as access to information about Chinese activists. Elderwood also targeted numerous other companies in the shipping, aeronautics, arms, energy, manufacturing, engineering, electronics, financial, and software sectors.\n\nThe \"APT\" designation for the Chinese threat actors responsible for attacking Google is APT17.\n\nElderwood specializes in attacking and infiltrating second-tier defense industry suppliers that make electronic or mechanical components for top defense companies. Those firms then become a cyber \"stepping stone\" to gain access to top-tier defense contractors. One attack procedure used by Elderwood is to infect legitimate websites frequented by employees of the target company \u2013 a so-called \"water hole\" attack, just as lions stake out a watering hole for their prey. Elderwood infects these less-secure sites with malware that downloads to a computer that clicks on the site. After that, the group searches inside the network to which the infected computer is connected, finding and then downloading executives' e-mails and critical documents on company plans, decisions, acquisitions, and product designs.\n\nAttack analysis\nIn its blog posting, Google stated that some of its intellectual property had been stolen. It suggested that the attackers were interested in accessing Gmail accounts of Chinese dissidents. According to the Financial Times, two accounts used by Ai Weiwei had been attacked, their contents read and copied; his bank accounts were investigated by state security agents who claimed he was under investigation for \"unspecified suspected crimes\". However, the attackers were only able to view details on two accounts and those details were limited to things such as the subject line and the accounts' creation date.\n\nSecurity experts immediately noted the sophistication of the attack. Two days after the attack became public, McAfee reported that the attackers had exploited purported zero-day vulnerabilities (unfixed and previously unknown to the target system developers) in Internet Explorer and dubbed the attack \"Operation Aurora\". A week after the report by McAfee, Microsoft issued a fix for the issue, and admitted that they had known about the security hole used since September. Additional vulnerabilities were found in Perforce, the source code revision software used by Google to manage their source code.\n\nVeriSign's iDefense Labs claimed that the attacks were perpetrated by \"agents of the Chinese state or proxies thereof\".\n\nAccording to a diplomatic cable from the U.S. Embassy in Beijing, a Chinese source reported that the Chinese Politburo directed the intrusion into Google's computer systems. The cable suggested that the attack was part of a coordinated campaign executed by \"government operatives, public security experts and Internet outlaws recruited by the Chinese government.\" The report suggested that it was part of an ongoing campaign in which attackers have \"broken into American government computers and those of Western allies, the Dalai Lama and American businesses since 2002.\" According to The Guardian's reporting on the leak, the attacks were \"orchestrated by a senior member of the Politburo who typed his own name into the global version of the search engine and found articles criticising him personally.\"\n\nOnce a victim's system was compromised, a backdoor connection that masqueraded as an SSL connection made connections to command and control servers running in Illinois, Texas, and Taiwan, including machines that were running under stolen Rackspace customer accounts. The victim's machine then began exploring the protected corporate intranet that it was a part of, searching for other vulnerable systems as well as sources of intellectual property, specifically the contents of source code repositories.\n\nThe attacks were thought to have definitively ended on Jan 4 when the command and control servers were taken down, although it is not known at this point whether or not the attackers intentionally shut them down. However, the attacks were still occurring as of February 2010.\n\nResponse and aftermath\nThe German, Australian, and French governments publicly issued warnings to users of Internet Explorer after the attack, advising them to use alternative browsers at least until a fix for the security hole was made. The German, Australian, and French governments considered all versions of Internet Explorer vulnerable or potentially vulnerable.\n\nIn an advisory on January 14, 2010, Microsoft said that attackers targeting Google and other U.S. companies used software that exploits a hole in Internet Explorer. The vulnerability affects Internet Explorer versions 6, 7, and 8 on Windows 7, Vista, Windows XP, Server 2003, Server 2008 R2, as well as IE 6 Service Pack 1 on Windows 2000 Service Pack 4.\n\nThe Internet Explorer exploit code used in the attack has been released into the public domain, and has been incorporated into the Metasploit Framework penetration testing tool. A copy of the exploit was uploaded to Wepawet, a service for detecting and analyzing web-based malware operated by the computer security group at the University of California, Santa Barbara. \"The public release of the exploit code increases the possibility of widespread attacks using the Internet Explorer vulnerability,\" said George Kurtz, CTO of McAfee, of the attack. \"The now public computer code may help cybercriminals craft attacks that use the vulnerability to compromise Windows systems.\"\n\nSecurity company Websense said it identified \"limited public use\" of the unpatched IE vulnerability in drive-by attacks against users who strayed onto malicious Web sites. According to Websense, the attack code it spotted is the same as the exploit that went public last week.[clarification needed] \"Internet Explorer users currently face a real and present danger due to the public disclosure of the vulnerability and release of attack code, increasing the possibility of widespread attacks,\" said George Kurtz, chief technology officer of McAfee, in a blog update. Confirming this speculation, Websense Security Labs identified additional sites using the exploit on January 19. According to reports from Ahnlab, the second URL was spread through the Instant Messenger network Misslee Messenger, a popular IM client in South Korea.\n\nResearchers have created attack code that exploits the vulnerability in Internet Explorer 7 (IE7) and IE8\u2014even when Microsoft's recommended defensive measure (Data Execution Prevention (DEP)) is turned on.[dubious \u2013 discuss] According to Dino Dai Zovi, a security vulnerability researcher, \"even the newest IE8 isn't safe from attack if it's running on Windows XP Service Pack 2 (SP2) or earlier, or on Windows Vista RTM (release to manufacturing), the version Microsoft shipped in January 2007.\"\n\nMicrosoft admitted that the security hole used had been known to them since September. Work on an update was prioritized and on Thursday, January 21, 2010, Microsoft released a security patch aiming to counter this weakness, the published exploits based on it and a number of other privately reported vulnerabilities. They did not state if any of the latter had been used or published by exploiters or whether these had any particular relation to the Aurora operation, but the entire cumulative update was termed critical for most versions of Windows, including Windows 7.\n\nSecurity researchers continued to investigate the attacks. HBGary, a security firm, released a report in which they claimed to have found some significant markers that might help identify the code developer. The firm also said that the code was Chinese language based but could not be specifically tied to any government entity.\n\nOn February 19, 2010, a security expert investigating the cyber-attack on Google, has claimed that the people behind the attack were also responsible for the cyber-attacks made on several Fortune 100 companies in the past one and a half years. They have also tracked the attack back to its point of origin, which seems to be two Chinese schools, Shanghai Jiao Tong University and Lanxiang Vocational School. As highlighted by The New York Times, both of these schools have ties with the Chinese search engine Baidu, a rival of Google China. Both Lanxiang Vocational and Jiaotong University have denied the allegation.\n\nIn March 2010, Symantec, which was helping investigate the attack for Google, identified Shaoxing as the source of 21.3% of all (12 billion) malicious emails sent throughout the world.\n\nGoogle retrospective\nOn October 3, 2022, Google on YouTube released a six-episode series covering the events that occurred during Operation Aurora, with commentary from insiders who dealt with the attack, though the series primary focus was to reassure the Google-using public that measures are in place to counter hacking attempts.\n"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Google, Adobe Systems, Akamai Technologies, Juniper Networks, Rackspace, Yahoo, Symantec, Northrop Grumman, Morgan Stanley, and Dow Chemical appear to have been targted in these attacks.

Primary factors include head size, length, weight, stiffness, and swingweight  \n\nHead size - Power is closely correlated to head size - the larger the head size, the more power can be generated, all other factors being equal.  A larger head size also provides larger hitting area and 'sweetspot'.  Smaller head sizes tend to equate to more control and maneuverability. \n\nLength - The standard length is a 27 inches, but can range from 26.5 inches to 29 inches.  A longer racquets provides more reach and often results in more power.  Similar to head size, longer racquets may limit maneuverability and control. \n\nWeight - The heavier the racquet, the more power you will generate (increasing the 'swingweight') of the racquet.  The lighter the racquet, the more maneuverable and easier it will be for players to get the racket to the right swing position.  The balance of the racquet is also critical as part of weight.  A more head light racket (more weight in the handle) provides increased maneuverability, especially when using a heavier racquet. A more balanced or head heavy racket are often reserved for lighter racquets to maintain the mass behind the ball\n\nStiffness - Generally speaking, the stiffer the racket, the less energy is lost as the ball is redirected with your racquet and thus, creating more power.  More flexible racquets allow for more feel and control.  Flexible racquets provide more comfort as less shock and impact is transferred to the arm and elbow.\n\nSwingweight - Swingweight measures how heavy a racquet feels when you swing it and the amount of power you can transfer to the ball.  Higher swingweight will also provide more stability in the racquet but will sacrifice maneuverability."}]}

The family travelled widely in Europe, including Spain. On his return to Argentina in 1921, Borges began publishing his poems and essays in surrealist literary journals. He also worked as a librarian and public lecturer. In 1955, he was appointed director of the National Public Library and professor of English Literature at the University of Buenos Aires. He became completely blind by the age of 55. Scholars have suggested that his progressive blindness helped him to create innovative literary symbols through imagination.[Note 1] By the 1960s, his work was translated and published widely in the United States and Europe. Borges himself was fluent in several languages.\n\nIn 1961, he came to international attention when he received the first Formentor Prize, which he shared with Samuel Beckett. In 1971, he won the Jerusalem Prize. His international reputation was consolidated in the 1960s, aided by the growing number of English translations, the Latin American Boom, and by the success of Garc\u00eda M\u00e1rquez's One Hundred Years of Solitude. He dedicated his final work, The Conspirators, to the city of Geneva, Switzerland. Writer and essayist J. M.

He served as his brother's closest advisor until the latter's 1963 assassination.\n\nHis tenure is known for advocating for the civil rights movement, the fight against organized crime and the Mafia, and involvement in U.S. foreign policy related to Cuba. He authored his account of the Cuban Missile Crisis in a book titled Thirteen Days. As attorney general, he authorized the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) to wiretap Martin Luther King Jr. and the Southern Christian Leadership Conference on a limited basis. After his brother's assassination, he remained in office during the Presidency of Lyndon B. Johnson for several months. He left to run for the United States Senate from New York in 1964 and defeated Republican incumbent Kenneth Keating. In office, Kennedy opposed U.S. involvement in the Vietnam War and raised awareness of poverty by sponsoring legislation designed to lure private business to blighted communities (i.e., Bedford Stuyvesant Restoration project). He was an advocate for issues related to human rights and social justice by traveling abroad to eastern Europe, Latin America, and South Africa, and formed working relationships with Martin Luther King Jr., Cesar Chavez, and Walter Reuther.\n\nIn 1968, Kennedy became a leading candidate for the Democratic nomination for the presidency by appealing to poor, African American, Hispanic, Catholic, and young voters. His main challenger in the race was Senator Eugene McCarthy. Shortly after winning the California primary around midnight on June 5, 1968, Kennedy was shot by Sirhan Sirhan, a 24-year-old Palestinian, allegedly in retaliation for his support of Israel following the 1967 Six-Day War. Kennedy died 25 hours later. Sirhan was arrested, tried, and convicted, though Kennedy's assassination, like his brother's, continues to be the subject of widespread analysis and numerous conspiracy theories."}]}

Many of the most popular shade trees are deciduous trees, however there are some great evergreen options as well.\n\nStarting with deciduous trees, there are flowering trees and traditional shade trees. Of the traditional shade trees, you may want to consider maples and oaks, of which there are many varieties. Red maples grow a bit slower than silver maples, but have hardier bark, beautiful red leaves in the fall, and a more pleasing traditional branching habit that many prefer vs, Silver maples. Sugar maples growth slower still, but are beautiful, prized trees that turn glowing orange in the fall and produce the sap used in maple syrup come spring. These trees can be 40-70 feet tall at maturity. Oaks are incredibly beautiful trees that are typically a little slower growing than maples, but have strong bark, enabling them to survive harsher conditions and have a long lifespan. They can handle being used as street trees as they do fine with moderate pollution levels and salt from de-icing. You really can't go wrong with maples or oaks as a summer shade tree, with their tall canopies providing wonderful shade once their leaves fill in during the spring.\n\nSome popular flowering options that provide ample shade include cherry and magnolia trees, both of which have beautiful showy spring flowers and reach a height of 20-60 feet at maturity depending on which of the many variants you choose (be careful with this as some are best suited to warmer climates and don't tolerate the cold as well). \n\nFor evergreens, the options are a bit more limited as many of these trees have low canopies that extend all the way to the ground. Many species of spruce and fir tree can have their canopies raised as they mature, creating space underneath for shade. Some pine trees have ample canopy under them, however their thin needle density can limit the amount of shade they provide.\n\nWhichever you ultimately choose, Shade trees add a ton of value to a home and are a great investment. Consider working with an arborist to make the decision based on your lighting and soil conditions. Enlisting a professional's help with planting will ensure your new tree is set up to grow healthy and strong."}]}

The Suns are one of four major league sports teams based in the Phoenix area, but are the only one to bill themselves as representing the city (the other teams - the Cardinals, Coyotes, and Diamondbacks - all bill themselves as representing the state of Arizona).\n\nThe franchise began play in 1968 as an expansion team, and their early years were mired in mediocrity, but their fortunes changed in the 1970s after partnering Dick Van Arsdale and Alvan Adams with Paul Westphal; the team reached the 1976 NBA Finals, in what is considered to be one of the biggest upsets in NBA history. However, after failing to capture a championship, the Suns would rebuild around Walter Davis for a majority of the 1980s, until the acquisition of Kevin Johnson in 1988.\n\nUnder Johnson, and after trading for perennial NBA All-Star Charles Barkley, and combined with the output of Tom Chambers and Dan Majerle, the Suns reached the playoffs for a franchise-record thirteen consecutive appearances and remained a regular title contender throughout the 1990s, and reached the 1993 NBA Finals. However, the team would again fail to win a championship, and entered into another period of mediocrity until the early part of the 2000s.\n\nIn 2004, the Suns signed free agent Steve Nash (who had blossomed for the Dallas Mavericks after being traded from Phoenix six years earlier), and returned into playoff contention. With Nash, Shawn Marion, and Amar'e Stoudemire, and under head coach Mike D'Antoni, the Suns became renowned worldwide for their quick, dynamic offense, which led them to tie a franchise record in wins in the 2004\u201305 season. Two more top two Conference placements followed, but the Suns again failed to attain an NBA championship, and were forced into another rebuild. After ten consecutive seasons without a playoff berth, the Suns reached the 2021 NBA Finals after acquiring Chris Paul, forming a quartet with their young core of Devin Booker, Deandre Ayton and Mikal Bridges. Following a disappointing playoff exit in 2022, the Suns acquired 13-time All-Star and two-time NBA champion Kevin Durant.\n\nThe Suns own the NBA's fifth-best all-time winning percentage, and have the second highest winning percentage of any team to have never won an NBA championship. 11 Hall of Famers have played for Phoenix, while two \u2014 Barkley and Nash \u2014 won NBA Most Valuable Player (MVP) while playing for the team.

This match is considered the greatest Premier League moment in history.\n\nCity entered the match in first place on goal difference, being level on points with local rivals Manchester United, and needed to match United's result to win the league.

Ch\u00e1vez was also leader of the Fifth Republic Movement political party from its foundation in 1997 until 2007, when it merged with several other parties to form the United Socialist Party of Venezuela (PSUV), which he led until 2012.\n\nBorn into a middle-class family in Sabaneta, Barinas, Ch\u00e1vez became a career military officer and, after becoming dissatisfied with the Venezuelan political system based on the Puntofijo Pact, he founded the clandestine Revolutionary Bolivarian Movement-200 (MBR-200) in the early 1980s. Ch\u00e1vez led the MBR-200 in its unsuccessful coup d'\u00e9tat against the Democratic Action government of President Carlos Andr\u00e9s P\u00e9rez in 1992, for which he was imprisoned. Pardoned from prison two years later, he founded the Fifth Republic Movement political party, and then receiving 56.2% of the vote, was elected president of Venezuela in 1998. He was re-elected in 2000 with 59.8% of the vote and again in 2006 with 62.8% of the vote. After winning his fourth term as president in the October 2012 presidential election with a decrease to 55.1% of the vote, he was to be sworn in on 10 January 2013. However, the inauguration was postponed due to his cancer treatment, and on 5 March at age 58, he died in Caracas.\n\nFollowing the adoption of a new constitution in 1999, Ch\u00e1vez focused on supposedly enacting social reforms as part of the Bolivarian Revolution. Using record-high oil revenues of the 2000s, his government nationalized key industries, created participatory democratic Communal Councils and implemented social programs known as the Bolivarian missions to expand access to food, housing, healthcare and education. The high oil profits coinciding with the start of Chavez's presidency resulted in temporary improvements in areas such as poverty, literacy, income equality and quality of life between primarily 2003 and 2007, though extensive changes in structural inequalities did not occur. On 2 June 2010, Ch\u00e1vez declared an \"economic war\" on Venezuela's upper classes due to shortages, arguably beginning the crisis in Venezuela. By the end of Ch\u00e1vez's presidency in the early 2010s, economic actions performed by his government during the preceding decade, such as deficit spending and price controls, proved to be unsustainable, with Venezuela's economy faltering. At the same time, poverty, inflation and shortages increased.\n\nUnder Ch\u00e1vez, Venezuela experienced democratic backsliding, as he suppressed the press, manipulated electoral laws, and arrested and exiled government critics. His use of enabling acts and his government's use of propaganda were controversial. Ch\u00e1vez's presidency saw significant increases in the country's murder rate[page needed] and continued corruption within the police force and government.\n\nAcross the political spectrum, Ch\u00e1vez is regarded as one of the most influential and controversial politicians in the modern history of Venezuela and Latin America. His 14-year presidency marked the start of the socialist \"pink tide\" sweeping Latin America\u2014he supported Latin American and Caribbean cooperation and was instrumental in setting up the pan-regional Union of South American Nations, the Community of Latin American and Caribbean States, the Bolivarian Alliance for the Americas, the Bank of the South and the regional television network TeleSUR. Internationally, Ch\u00e1vez aligned himself with the Marxist\u2013Leninist governments of Fidel and then Ra\u00fal Castro in Cuba, as well as the socialist governments of Evo Morales in Bolivia, Rafael Correa in Ecuador and Daniel Ortega in Nicaragua. Ch\u00e1vez's ideas, programs, and style form the basis of \"Chavismo\", a political ideology closely associated with Bolivarianism and socialism of the 21st century. Ch\u00e1vez described his policies as anti-imperialist, being a prominent adversary of the United States's foreign policy as well as a vocal critic of neoliberalism and laissez-faire capitalism. He described himself as a Marxist."}]}

Who performed at the halftime show?\n2. Which team won and what was the final score?\n3. Who was the MVP?\n4. Where was the game played?\n\nNow complete the following instance -\nInput: Super Bowl LV was an American football game played to determine the champion of the National Football League (NFL) for the 2020 season. The National Football Conference (NFC) champion Tampa Bay Buccaneers defeated the defending American Football Conference (AFC) and Super Bowl champion Kansas City Chiefs, 31\u20139. The game was played on February 7, 2021, at Raymond James Stadium in Tampa, Florida, the home stadium of the Buccaneers, marking the first time a team played a Super Bowl in its home stadium. Due to COVID-19 protocols limiting the stadium's seating capacity to 25,000 fans, it was the least-attended Super Bowl.\n\nThe Buccaneers' victory was their second and made them one of two teams, along with the Baltimore Ravens, to be undefeated in multiple Super Bowls. They finished the regular season with an 11\u20135 record and a wild card berth to advance to their second Super Bowl appearance through the guidance of several new acquisitions, most notably 21-year veteran quarterback Tom Brady in his first season away from the New England Patriots. The Chiefs, aided by their top-ranked offense, finished the regular season with a league-best 14\u20132 record to advance to their fourth Super Bowl appearance and were the defending Super Bowl LIV champions, seeking to become the first repeat champions since the Patriots in 2004.\n\nFor the first time under quarterback Patrick Mahomes, the Chiefs failed to score a touchdown and lost by double-digits, making them the third Super Bowl team to not score a touchdown. They also committed 11 penalties for 120 yards, including a record eight penalties for 95 yards in the first half, most of which were called against the defense. The Buccaneers capitalized on these struggles to take a commanding 21\u20136 lead at halftime and dominated the remainder of the game. Brady, who also extended his player records for Super Bowl appearances to 10 and wins to seven, was named Super Bowl MVP for a record fifth time and was the first to receive the award with multiple franchises. He became the oldest player to receive the honor and win a Super Bowl as the starting quarterback at age 43, breaking additional personal records, while Bruce Arians was the oldest head coach to win the Super Bowl at 68.\n\nThe game was televised nationally by CBS. Country music singer Eric Church and R&B singer Jazmine Sullivan performed the national anthem, while the halftime show was headlined by Canadian singer The Weeknd. On television, Super Bowl LV was seen by 91.63 million viewers, the lowest ratings for the game since 2006. Combined with viewership on other platforms, viewership was down by 5% overall in comparison to Super Bowl LIV, but with a 69% increase in average streaming viewership.\nOutput:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Given the provided reference text, the answers to the questions are as follows:\n1.

He won three of the four majors and the ATP Finals in 2004, 2006, and 2007 as well as five consecutive titles at both Wimbledon and the US Open. He completed the career Grand Slam at the 2009 French Open after three consecutive runner-up finishes to Nadal, his main rival until 2010.

Koalas from the northern populations are typically smaller and lighter in colour than their counterparts further south. These populations possibly are separate subspecies, but this is disputed.\n\nKoalas typically inhabit open Eucalyptus woodland, as the leaves of these trees make up most of their diet. This eucalypt diet has low nutritional and caloric content and contains toxins that deter most other mammals from feeding on it. Koalas are largely sedentary and sleep up to twenty hours a day. They are asocial animals, and bonding exists only between mothers and dependent offspring. Adult males communicate with loud bellows that intimidate rivals and attract mates. Males mark their presence with secretions from scent glands located on their chests. Being marsupials, koalas give birth to underdeveloped young that crawl into their mothers' pouches, where they stay for the first six to seven months of their lives. These young koalas, known as joeys, are fully weaned around a year old. Koalas have few natural predators and parasites, but are threatened by various pathogens, such as Chlamydiaceae bacteria and koala retrovirus.\n\nOutput:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Eucalyptus makes up most of their diet.

White of the Sherwood Conservatory of Music Columbia College Chicago and Karel Paukert at Northwestern University. His theatre organ teacher was Al Melgard, famous as the Staff Organist on the Barton organ at the Chicago Stadium. When Melgard retired in 1975 he gave Strony his Oak Park, IL teaching studio. Strony later studied piano with Giulio Favrio of the Lyric Opera of Chicago.\n\nHe made his public debut as an organist in 1974, aged 18. During his college years he began playing the theatre organ in pizza parlors, a fad in the 1970s which gave new life to a largely forgotten instrument. For many years thereafter he was Artist-in-Residence at First Christian Church in Las Vegas, Nevada.\n\nStrony has studied with silent-film accompanists and has accompanied silent films for years, such as The Phantom of the Opera (1925 film) and Nosferatu at the Plaza Theatre (El Paso).\n\nPerformances\nHe has performed in the United States, toured extensively in Australia (1978), England (1989), Japan (Expo \u201875 & 2011), and Canada (1999), and he is a regular performer at conventions of the American Theatre Organ Society. In 2012 he played his 39th ATOS convention, more than any other organist. He played there again in 2008. He has also performed for the American Guild of Organists on both local and national levels.\n\nHe has performed on numerous classical instruments as well, most notably having been featured in June 2009 at Macy's in Philadelphia (formerly Wanamaker\u2019s) playing the largest operating pipe organ in the world. He has also recorded on the world\u2019s largest theatre organ at the Sanfillipo Music Room in Barrington, IL.\n\nIn addition to solo concerts, he has performed with several symphony orchestras. In El Paso he played music including Symphony No. 3 (Organ) of Camille Saint-Sa\u00ebns. He played at the Calgary International Organ Festival with the Calgary Philharmonic. Additionally, he has performed with the Allentown Symphony and Symphony Silicon Valley. While in college he performed the Poulenc Organ Concerto with the Chicago Businessman\u2019s Orchestra.\n\nAwards\nIn 1991 and 1993 the American Theatre Organ Society selected him as \"Organist of the Year.\" He is the only living organist to have received this award twice. In 2011 he was inducted into the American Theatre Organ Society Hall of Fame.\n\nIn the spring of 2008, and in celebration of his career, the Allen Organ Company developed the Walt Strony Signature Model - the STR-4 - which is a four-manual instrument. Strony designed the stoplist and chose all the samples from their extensive library based upon his experience as an organist and tonal consultant.\n\nOther work\nHis book The Secrets of Theatre Organ Registration (1991) was the first book to be written about this subject.

It is also a popular dessert in Japan. The characteristic rings that appear in its slices resemble tree rings, and give the cake its German name, Baumkuchen, which literally translates to \"tree cake\" or \"log cake\".\n\nHistory\nIt is disputed who made the first Baumkuchen and where it was first baked. One theory is that it was invented in the German town of Salzwedel, which is further popularized by the town itself. Another theory suggests it began as a Hungarian wedding cake.[citation needed] In Ein new Kochbuch (lit. \"A New Cookbook\"), the first cookbook written for professional chefs by Marx Rumpolt, there is a recipe for Baumkuchen. This publication puts the origin of Baumkuchen as far back at 1581, the year the cookbook was first published. Marx Rumpolt had previously worked as a chef in Hungary and Bohemia.[citation needed]\n\nCharacteristics\n\nBaumkuchen baked on a spit\nTraditionally, Baumkuchen is made on a spit by brushing on even layers of batter and then rotating the spit around a heat source. Each layer is allowed to brown before a new layer of batter is poured. When the cake is removed and sliced, each layer is divided from the next by a golden line, resembling the growth rings on a crosscut tree. A typical Baumkuchen is made up of 15 to 20 layers of batter. However, the layering process for making Baumkuchen can continue until the cakes are quite large. Skilled pastry chefs have been known to create cakes with 25 layers and weighing over 100 pounds (45 kg). When cooked on a spit, it is not uncommon for a finished Baumkuchen to be 3\u20134 feet (0.91\u20131.22 m) tall.\n\nBaumkuchen ingredients are typically butter, eggs, sugar, vanilla, salt, and flour. Baking powder is not considered a traditional ingredient. The ratio of flour, butter and eggs is typically 1:1:2 respectively (i.e., 100 grams of flour, 100 grams of butter and 200 grams of eggs). The recipe can be varied by adding other ingredients, such as ground nuts, honey, marzipan, nougat and rum or brandy, to the batter or filling. Additionally, Baumkuchen may be covered with sugar or chocolate glaze. With some recipes, the fully baked and cooled Baumkuchen is first coated with marmalade or jam, and then covered with chocolate.\n\n"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Baumkuchen ingredients are typically butter, eggs, sugar, vanilla, salt, and flour.

Members of the Grateful Dead, originally known as the Warlocks, had played together in various Bay Area ensembles, including the traditional jug band Mother McCree's Uptown Jug Champions. Lesh was the last member to join the Warlocks before they changed their name to the Grateful Dead; replacing Dana Morgan Jr., who had played bass for a few gigs. Drummer Mickey Hart and non-performing lyricist Robert Hunter joined in 1967. With the exception of McKernan, who died in 1973, and Hart, who took time off from 1971 to 1974, the core of the band stayed together for its entire 30-year history.

Try to break them down into smaller, manageable chunks and complete them one by one.\n3. Take a break: It is scientifically proven that brain productivity increases after having a short break. Consider scheduling frequent short breaks of 10-15 minutes. Make sure you step away from your work environment. This will help your mind to have a rest and come up with new ideas after the break.\n4. Complete the hardest task first: The most complex or hardest task can be intimidating to start with and we tend to avoid them therefore. Try to start with one of these tasks. It can energize and motivate you throughout the day, helping you accomplish a lot of smaller tasks.\n5. Delegate: If you are part of a team, consider collaborating with team members more closely. Delegation is not about offloading work. Instead, it is about better task allocation ensuring each team member works on a task that is best suited to their skills and availability."}]}

He previously served as the 37th vice president from 1961 to 1963 under President John F. Kennedy, and was sworn in shortly after Kennedy's assassination. A Democrat from Texas, Johnson also served as a U.S. representative, U.S. Senator and the Senate's majority leader. He holds the distinction of being one of the few presidents who served in all elected offices at the federal level.\n\nAnswer:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Lyndon Baines Johnson (/\u02c8l\u026and\u0259n \u02c8be\u026anz/; August 27, 1908 \u2013 January 22, 1973), often referred to by his initials LBJ, was an American politician who served as the 36th president of the United States from 1963 to 1969. He previously served as the 37th vice president from 1961 to 1963 under President John F. Kennedy, and was sworn in shortly after Kennedy's assassination. A Democrat from Texas, Johnson also served as a U.S. representative, U.S. Senator and the Senate's majority leader. He holds the distinction of being one of the few presidents who served in all elected offices at the federal level.\n\nBorn in a farmhouse in Stonewall, Texas, to a local political family, Johnson worked as a high school teacher and a congressional aide before winning election to the U.S. House of Representatives in 1937. In 1948, he won the 1948 Senate election in Texas after a narrow and controversial victory in the Democratic Party's primary. He was appointed to the position of Senate Majority Whip in 1951. He became the Senate Democratic leader in 1953 and majority leader in 1954. In 1960 Johnson ran for the Democratic nomination for president. Ultimately, Senator Kennedy bested Johnson and his other rivals for the nomination, then surprised many by offering to make Johnson his vice presidential running mate. The Kennedy-Johnson ticket won in the 1960 presidential election. Vice President Johnson assumed the presidency on November 22, 1963, after President Kennedy was assassinated. The following year Johnson was elected to the presidency when he won in a landslide against Arizona Senator Barry Goldwater, receiving 61.1% of the popular vote in the 1964 presidential election, the largest share won by any presidential candidate since the 1820 election.\n\nJohnson's domestic policy was aimed at expanding civil rights, public broadcasting, access to healthcare, aid to education and the arts, urban and rural development, and public services. In 1964 Johnson coined the term the \"Great Society\" to describe these efforts. In addition, he sought to create better living conditions for low-income Americans by spearheading a campaign unofficially called the \"War on Poverty\". As part of these efforts, Johnson signed the Social Security Amendments of 1965, which resulted in the creation of Medicare and Medicaid. Johnson followed his predecessor's actions in bolstering NASA and made the Apollo Program a national priority. He enacted the Higher Education Act of 1965 which established federally insured student loans. Johnson signed the Immigration and Nationality Act of 1965 which laid the groundwork for U.S. immigration policy today. Johnson's opinion on the issue of civil rights put him at odds with other white, southern Democrats. His civil rights legacy was shaped by signing the Civil Rights Act of 1964, the Voting Rights Act of 1965, and the Civil Rights Act of 1968. During his presidency, the American political landscape transformed significantly, as white southerners who were once staunch Democrats began moving to the Republican Party and black voters began moving to the Democratic Party. Because of his domestic agenda, Johnson's presidency marked the peak of modern liberalism in the United States.\n\nJohnson's presidency took place during the Cold War, thus his foreign policy prioritized containment of communism. Prior to his presidency, the U.S. was already involved in the Vietnam War, supporting South Vietnam against the communist North. Following a naval skirmish in 1964 between the United States and North Vietnam, Congress passed the Gulf of Tonkin Resolution, which granted Johnson the power to launch a full-scale military intervention in South East Asia. The number of American military personnel in Vietnam increased dramatically, and casualties soared among U.S. soldiers and Vietnamese civilians. Johnson also expanded military operations in neighboring Laos to destroy North Vietnamese supply lines. In 1968, the communist Tet Offensive inflamed the anti-war movement, especially among draft-age students on university campuses, and public opinion turned against America's involvement in the war. In Europe, Johnson's administration continued to promote and foster Western European political and economic cooperation and integration as his predecessors had.\n\nAt home, Johnson faced further troubles with race riots in major cities and increasing crime rates. His political opponents seized the opportunity and raised demands for \"law and order\" policies. Johnson began his presidency with near-universal support, but his approval declined throughout his presidency as the public became frustrated with both the Vietnam War and domestic unrest. Johnson initially sought to run for re-election; however, following disappointing results in the New Hampshire primary he withdrew his candidacy. The war was a major election issue and the 1968 presidential election saw Republican candidate Richard Nixon defeat Johnson's vice president Hubert Humphrey. At the end of his presidency in 1969, Johnson returned to his Texas ranch, published his memoirs, and in other respects kept a low profile until he died of a heart attack in 1973.\n\nJohnson is one of the most controversial presidents in American history. Public opinion and academic assessments of his legacy have fluctuated greatly ever since his death. Historians and scholars rank Johnson in the upper tier because of his accomplishments regarding domestic policy. His administration passed many major laws that made substantial changes in civil rights, health care, welfare, and education. Conversely, Johnson is strongly criticized for his foreign policy, namely escalating American involvement in the Vietnam War."}]}

The capital and largest urban agglomeration is the city of Caracas.\n\nThe continental territory is bordered on the north by the Caribbean Sea and the Atlantic Ocean, on the west by Colombia, Brazil on the south, Trinidad and Tobago to the north-east and on the east by Guyana. The Venezuelan government maintains a claim against Guyana to Guayana Esequiba. Venezuela is a federal presidential republic consisting of 23 states, the Capital District and federal dependencies covering Venezuela's offshore islands. Venezuela is among the most urbanized countries in Latin America; the vast majority of Venezuelans live in the cities of the north and in the capital.\n\nThe territory of Venezuela was colonized by Spain in 1522 amid resistance from indigenous peoples. In 1811, it became one of the first Spanish-American territories to declare independence from the Spanish and to form part, as a department, of the first federal Republic of Colombia (historiographically known as Gran Colombia). It separated as a full sovereign country in 1830. During the 19th century, Venezuela suffered political turmoil and autocracy, remaining dominated by regional military dictators until the mid-20th century. Since 1958, the country has had a series of democratic governments, as an exception where most of the region was ruled by military dictatorships, and the period was characterized by economic prosperity. Economic shocks in the 1980s and 1990s led to major political crises and widespread social unrest, including the deadly Caracazo riots of 1989, two attempted coups in 1992, and the impeachment of a President for embezzlement of public funds charges in 1993. The collapse in confidence in the existing parties saw the 1998 Venezuelan presidential election, the catalyst for the Bolivarian Revolution, which began with a 1999 Constituent Assembly, where a new Constitution of Venezuela was imposed. The government's populist social welfare policies were bolstered by soaring oil prices, temporarily increasing social spending, and reducing economic inequality and poverty in the early years of the regime. However, poverty began to increase in the 2010s. The 2013 Venezuelan presidential election was widely disputed leading to widespread protest, which triggered another nationwide crisis that continues to this day. Venezuela has experienced democratic backsliding, shifting into an authoritarian state. It ranks low in international measurements of freedom of the press and civil liberties and has high levels of perceived corruption.\n\nVenezuela is a developing country and ranks 113th on the Human Development Index. It has the world's largest known oil reserves and has been one of the world's leading exporters of oil. Previously, the country was an underdeveloped exporter of agricultural commodities such as coffee and cocoa, but oil quickly came to dominate exports and government revenues. The excesses and poor policies of the incumbent government led to the collapse of Venezuela's entire economy. The country struggles with record hyperinflation, shortages of basic goods, unemployment, poverty, disease, high child mortality, malnutrition, severe crime and corruption. These factors have precipitated the Venezuelan migrant crisis where more than three million people have fled the country. By 2017, Venezuela was declared to be in default regarding debt payments by credit rating agencies. The crisis in Venezuela has contributed to a rapidly deteriorating human rights situation, including increased abuses such as torture, arbitrary imprisonment, extrajudicial killings and attacks on human rights advocates. Venezuela is a charter member of the UN, Organization of American States (OAS), Union of South American Nations (UNASUR), ALBA, Mercosur, Latin American Integration Association (LAIA) and Organization of Ibero-American States (OEI)."}]}

He was the founder of Ford Motor Company, and chief developer of the assembly line technique of mass production. Ford created the first automobile that middle-class Americans could afford, and his conversion of the automobile from an expensive luxury into an accessible conveyance profoundly impacted the landscape of the 20th century.\n\nFord was born on a farm in Michigan's Springwells Township to a Belgian family, leaving home at age 16 to work in Detroit. It was a few years before this time that Ford first experienced automobiles, and throughout the later half of the 1880s, Ford began repairing and later constructing engines, and through the 1890s worked with a division of Edison Electric. He officially founded Ford Motor Company in 1903, after prior failures in business but success in constructing automobiles.\n\nFord's 1908 introduction of the Model T automobile revolutionized both transportation and American industry. As the Ford Motor Company sole owner, he became one of the richest and best-known people in the world. He is credited with \"Fordism\", the mass production of inexpensive goods coupled with high wages for workers. Ford was also among the pioneers of the five-day work week. Ford had a global vision, with consumerism as the key to peace. His intense commitment to systematically lowering costs resulted in many technical and business innovations, including a franchise system that put dealerships throughout North America and major cities on six continents.\n\nFord was widely known for his pacifism during the first years of World War I. In the 1920s Ford promoted antisemitic content through his newspaper The Dearborn Independent, and the book, The International Jew. After his son Edsel died in 1943, Ford resumed control of the company but was too frail to make decisions and quickly came under the control of subordinates. He turned over the company to his grandson Henry Ford II in 1945. He died in 1947 after leaving most of his wealth to the Ford Foundation, and control of the company to his family."}]}

The first day consists of evening followed by morning. The Jewish calendar abides by this tradition.  Its days are not morning to morning. Its days are night to night (as marked by sundown).  \n\nAs an example, the Jewish sabbath (Shabbat) is on the 7th day of the week. Shabbat = Shevat in Hebrew, which literally translates to the number seven.  The seventh day of the  week is is Saturday. However, Shabbat doesn't span Saturday morning to Sunday morning.

Pure white buttercream does not exist, as the color of butter is slightly yellow, which will give your buttercream frosting a small amount of color.

He does not focus on excelling in any activities and often spends time with his friends Tsubaki Sawabe and Ry\u014dta Watari.

The event is traditionally held over Memorial Day weekend, usually the last weekend of May. It is contested as part of the IndyCar Series, the top level of American open-wheel car racing, a formula colloquially known as \"Indy car racing\". The track itself is nicknamed the \"Brickyard\", as the racing surface was paved in brick in the fall of 1909. One yard of brick remains exposed at the start/finish line. The event, billed as The Greatest Spectacle in Racing, is considered part of the Triple Crown of Motorsport along with the 24 Hours of Le Mans and the Monaco Grand Prix, with which it typically shares a date.\n\nThe inaugural race was held in 1911 and was won by Ray Harroun. The event celebrated its 100th anniversary in 2011, and the 100th running was held in 2016. The event was put on hiatus twice, from 1917 to 1918 due to World War I and from 1942 to 1945 due to World War II. In two different periods, the race was part of FIA World Championships; between 1925 and 1928, the World Manufacturers' Championship and between 1950 and 1960, the World Drivers' Championship.\n\nMarcus Ericsson is the current champion. The most successful drivers are A. J. Foyt, Al Unser Sr., Rick Mears and H\u00e9lio Castroneves, each of whom has won the race four times. The active driver with the most victories is H\u00e9lio Castroneves. Rick Mears holds the record for most career pole positions with six. The most successful car owner is Roger Penske, owner of the Indianapolis Motor Speedway and Team Penske, which has 18 total wins and 18 poles. Penske also has five wins at the IndyCar Grand Prix, held on the combined road course.\n\nThe event is steeped in tradition, in pre-race ceremonies, post-race celebrations, and race procedure. The most noteworthy and most popular traditions are the 33-car field lining up three-wide for the start, the annual singing of the chorus of \"Back Home Again in Indiana,\" and the victory lane bottle of milk. Also unique is that qualifying requires the driver to complete four, rather than one, timed laps. Qualifying has a separate weekend. The official attendance is not disclosed by Speedway management, but the permanent seating capacity is upwards of 250,000, and infield patrons raise the race-day attendance to approximately 300,000."}]}

In 1954, the Western Development Division, under General Bernard Schriever, was established as the first dedicated space organization within the U.S. Armed Forces and continues to exist as the Space Force's Space and Missile Systems Center. Military space forces were organized under several different Air Force major commands until they were unified when Air Force Space Command was established on 1 September 1982. U.S. space forces first began conducting combat support operations in the Vietnam War and continued to provide satellite communications, weather, and navigation support during the 1982 Falklands War, 1983 United States invasion of Grenada, 1986 United States bombing of Libya, and 1989 United States invasion of Panama. The first major employment of space forces culminated in the Gulf War, where they proved so critical to the U.S.-led coalition that it is sometimes referred to as the first \"space war\".\n\nThe first discussions of creating a military space service occurred in 1958, and it was nearly established in 1982 by President Ronald Reagan as part of the Strategic Defense Initiative, but the idea dissolved with treaty compliance concerns. A 2001 Space Commission argued for the creation of a Space Corps around 2007\u20132011, but no action was taken by the Obama Administration. On 20 December 2019, the United States Space Force Act was signed into law as part of the National Defense Authorization Act, reorganizing Air Force Space Command and other space elements into the United States Space Force, and creating the first new independent military service since the Army Air Forces were reorganized as the U.S. Air Force in 1947.\n"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "The United States Space Force Act was signed into law as part of the National Defense Authorization Act on December 20, 2019.

{"dataset": "alpagasus_3k_dolly", "id": "alpagasus_3k_499", "messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What is the origin of man?\n\nAdditional Context:\nHumans (Homo sapiens) are the most common and widespread species of primate in the great ape family Hominidae, and also the most common species of primate overall. Humans are broadly characterized by their bipedalism and high intelligence. Humans' large brain and resulting cognitive skills have allowed them to thrive in a variety of environments and develop complex societies and civilizations. Humans are highly social and tend to live in complex social structures composed of many cooperating and competing groups, from families and kinship networks to political states. As such, social interactions between humans have established a wide variety of values, social norms, languages, and rituals, each of which bolsters human society. The desire to understand and influence phenomena has motivated humanity's development of science, technology, philosophy, mythology, religion, and other conceptual frameworks.\n\nAlthough some scientists equate the term \"humans\" with all members of the genus Homo, in common usage it generally refers to Homo sapiens, the only extant member. Anatomically modern humans emerged around 300,000 years ago in Africa, evolving from Homo heidelbergensis or a similar species and migrating out of Africa, gradually replacing or interbreeding with local populations of archaic humans. For most of history, humans were nomadic hunter-gatherers. Humans began exhibiting behavioral modernity about 160,000\u201360,000 years ago. The Neolithic Revolution, which began in Southwest Asia around 13,000 years ago (and separately in a few other places), saw the emergence of agriculture and permanent human settlement. As populations became larger and denser, forms of governance developed within and between communities, and a number of civilizations have risen and fallen. Humans have continued to expand, with a global population of over 8 billion as of 2022.\n\nGenes and the environment influence human biological variation in visible characteristics, physiology, disease susceptibility, mental abilities, body size, and life span. Though humans vary in many traits (such as genetic predispositions and physical features), any two humans are at least 99% genetically similar. Humans are sexually dimorphic: generally, males have greater body strength and females have a higher body fat percentage. At puberty, humans develop secondary sexual characteristics. Females are capable of pregnancy, usually between puberty, at around 12 years old, and menopause, around the age of 50.\n\nHumans are omnivorous, capable of consuming a wide variety of plant and animal material, and have used fire and other forms of heat to prepare and cook food since the time of Homo erectus. Humans can survive for up to eight weeks without food and three or four days without water. Humans are generally diurnal, sleeping on average seven to nine hours per day. Childbirth is dangerous, with a high risk of complications and death. Often, both the mother and the father provide care for their children, who are helpless at birth.\n\nHumans have a large, highly developed, and complex prefrontal cortex, the region of the brain associated with higher cognition. Humans are highly intelligent, capable of episodic memory, have flexible facial expressions, self-awareness, and a theory of mind. The human mind is capable of introspection, private thought, imagination, volition, and forming views on existence. This has allowed great technological advancements and complex tool development to be possible through complex reasoning and the transmission of knowledge to subsequent generations. Language, art, and trade are defining characteristics of humans. Long-distance trade routes might have led to cultural explosions and resource distribution that gave humans an advantage over other similar species.\n\nAnswer:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Homo sapiens\nAnatomically modern humans emerged around 300,000 years ago in Africa, evolving from Homo heidelbergensis or a similar species and migrating out of Africa, gradually replacing or interbreeding with local populations of archaic humans.

GWA studies typically focus on associations between single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and traits like major human diseases, but can equally be applied to any other genetic variants and any other organisms.\n\nWhen applied to human data, GWA studies compare the DNA of participants having varying phenotypes for a particular trait or disease. These participants may be people with a disease (cases) and similar people without the disease (controls), or they may be people with different phenotypes for a particular trait, for example blood pressure. This approach is known as phenotype-first, in which the participants are classified first by their clinical manifestation(s), as opposed to genotype-first. Each person gives a sample of DNA, from which millions of genetic variants are read using SNP arrays. If there is significant statistical evidence that one type of the variant (one allele) is more frequent in people with the disease, the variant is said to be associated with the disease. The associated SNPs are then considered to mark a region of the human genome that may influence the risk of disease.\n\nGWA studies investigate the entire genome, in contrast to methods that specifically test a small number of pre-specified genetic regions. Hence, GWAS is a non-candidate-driven approach, in contrast to gene-specific candidate-driven studies. GWA studies identify SNPs and other variants in DNA associated with a disease, but they cannot on their own specify which genes are causal.\n\nThe first successful GWAS published in 2002 studied myocardial infarction. This study design was then implemented in the landmark GWA 2005 study investigating patients with age-related macular degeneration, and found two SNPs with significantly altered allele frequency compared to healthy controls. As of 2017, over 3,000 human GWA studies have examined over 1,800 diseases and traits, and thousands of SNP associations have been found. Except in the case of rare genetic diseases, these associations are very weak, but while they may not explain much of the risk, they provide insight into genes and pathways that can be important."}]}

The precise function of palmitoylation depends on the particular protein being considered. Palmitoylation enhances the hydrophobicity of proteins and contributes to their membrane association. Palmitoylation also appears to play a significant role in subcellular trafficking of proteins between membrane compartments, as well as in modulating protein\u2013protein interactions. In contrast to prenylation and myristoylation, palmitoylation is usually reversible (because the bond between palmitic acid and protein is often a thioester bond). The reverse reaction in mammalian cells is catalyzed by acyl-protein thioesterases (APTs) in the cytosol and palmitoyl protein thioesterases in lysosomes. Because palmitoylation is a dynamic, post-translational process, it is believed to be employed by the cell to alter the subcellular localization, protein\u2013protein interactions, or binding capacities of a protein.\n\nAn example of a protein that undergoes palmitoylation is hemagglutinin, a membrane glycoprotein used by influenza to attach to host cell receptors. The palmitoylation cycles of a wide array of enzymes have been characterized in the past few years, including H-Ras, Gs\u03b1, the \u03b22-adrenergic receptor, and endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS). In signal transduction via G protein, palmitoylation of the \u03b1 subunit, prenylation of the \u03b3 subunit, and myristoylation is involved in tethering the G protein to the inner surface of the plasma membrane so that the G protein can interact with its receptor."}]}

They are regarded as the most influential band of all time and were integral to the development of 1960s counterculture and popular music's recognition as an art form. Rooted in skiffle, beat and 1950s rock 'n' roll, their sound incorporated elements of classical music and traditional pop in innovative ways; the band also explored music styles ranging from folk and Indian music to psychedelia and hard rock. As pioneers in recording, songwriting and artistic presentation, the Beatles revolutionised many aspects of the music industry and were often publicised as leaders of the era's youth and sociocultural movements.\n\nAnswer:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "ed by primary songwriters Lennon and McCartney, the Beatles evolved from Lennon's previous group, the Quarrymen, and built their reputation playing clubs in Liverpool and Hamburg over three years from 1960, initially with Stuart Sutcliffe playing bass. The core trio of Lennon, McCartney and Harrison, together since 1958, went through a succession of drummers, including Pete Best, before asking Starr to join them in 1962. Manager Brian Epstein moulded them into a professional act, and producer George Martin guided and developed their recordings, greatly expanding their domestic success after signing to EMI Records and achieving their first hit, \"Love Me Do\", in late 1962. As their popularity grew into the intense fan frenzy dubbed \"Beatlemania\", the band acquired the nickname \"the Fab Four\", with Epstein, Martin or another member of the band's entourage sometimes informally referred to as a \"fifth Beatle\".\n\nBy early 1964, the Beatles were international stars and had achieved unprecedented levels of critical and commercial success. They became a leading force in Britain's cultural resurgence, ushering in the British Invasion of the United States pop market, and soon made their film debut with A Hard Day's Night (1964). A growing desire to refine their studio efforts, coupled with the untenable nature of their concert tours, led to the band's retirement from live performances in 1966. At this time, they produced records of greater sophistication, including the albums Rubber Soul (1965), Revolver (1966) and Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band (1967), and enjoyed further commercial success with The Beatles (also known as \"the White Album\", 1968) and Abbey Road (1969). The success of these records heralded the album era, as albums became the dominant form of record consumption over singles; they also increased public interest in psychedelic drugs and Eastern spirituality, and furthered advancements in electronic music, album art and music videos. In 1968, they founded Apple Corps, a multi-armed multimedia corporation that continues to oversee projects related to the band's legacy. After the group's break-up in 1970, all principal former members enjoyed success as solo artists and some partial reunions have occurred. Lennon was murdered in 1980 and Harrison died of lung cancer in 2001. McCartney and Starr remain musically active.\n\nThe Beatles are the best-selling music act of all time, with estimated sales of 600 million units worldwide. They are the most successful act in the history of the US Billboard charts. They hold the record for most number-one albums on the UK Albums Chart (15), most number-one hits on the US Billboard Hot 100 chart (20), and most singles sold in the UK (21.9 million). The band received many accolades, including seven Grammy Awards, four Brit Awards, an Academy Award (for Best Original Song Score for the 1970 documentary film Let It Be) and fifteen Ivor Novello Awards. They were inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1988, and each principal member was inducted individually between 1994 and 2015. In 2004 and 2011, the group topped Rolling Stone's lists of the greatest artists in history. Time magazine named them among the 20th century's 100 most important people."}]}

Java applications are typically compiled to bytecode that can run on any Java virtual machine (JVM) regardless of the underlying computer architecture. The syntax of Java is similar to C and C++, but has fewer low-level facilities than either of them. The Java runtime provides dynamic capabilities (such as reflection and runtime code modification) that are typically not available in traditional compiled languages. As of 2019, Java was one of the most popular programming languages in use according to GitHub, particularly for client\u2013server web applications, with a reported 9 million developers."}]}

He was already well known from his earlier work, and had developed a reputation as a brilliant researcher. In 1928, he studied the variation of Staphylococcus aureus grown under natural condition, after the work of Joseph Warwick Bigger, who discovered that the bacterium could grow into a variety of types (strains). On 3 September 1928, Fleming returned to his laboratory having spent a holiday with his family at Suffolk. Before leaving for his holiday, he inoculated staphylococci on culture plates and left them on a bench in a corner of his laboratory. On his return, Fleming noticed that one culture was contaminated with a fungus, and that the colonies of staphylococci immediately surrounding the fungus had been destroyed, whereas other staphylococci colonies farther away were normal, famously remarking \"That's funny\". Fleming showed the contaminated culture to his former assistant Merlin Pryce, who reminded him, \"That's how you discovered lysozyme.\" He identified the mould as being from the genus Penicillium. He suspected it to be P. chrysogenum, but a colleague Charles J. La Touche identified it as P. rubrum. (It was later corrected as P. notatum and then officially accepted as P. chrysogenum; in 2011, it was resolved as P. rubens.)\nThe laboratory in which Fleming discovered and tested penicillin is preserved as the Alexander Fleming Laboratory Museum in St. Mary's Hospital, Paddington. The source of the fungal contaminant was established in 1966 as coming from La Touche's room, which was directly below Fleming's.\nFleming grew the mould in a pure culture and found that the culture broth contained an antibacterial substance. He investigated its anti-bacterial effect on many organisms, and noticed that it affected bacteria such as staphylococci and many other Gram-positive pathogens that cause scarlet fever, pneumonia, meningitis and diphtheria, but not typhoid fever or paratyphoid fever, which are caused by Gram-negative bacteria, for which he was seeking a cure at the time. It also affected Neisseria gonorrhoeae, which causes gonorrhoea, although this bacterium is Gram-negative. After some months of calling it \"mould juice\" or \"the inhibitor\", he gave the name penicillin on 7 March 1929 for the antibacterial substance present in the mould.\nOutput:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Penicillin has an anti-bacterial effect of a number of Gram-positive bacteria including but not limited to the bacteria that cause meningitis, diptheria, pneumonia, scarlet fever.  It also acts on (Gram-positive) staphylococci bacteria which cause skin and soft tissue infections such as boils.  Penicillin was also found to have an anti-bacterial action on the Gram-negative bacteria which causes gonorrhoea.  There were a series of fortuitous circumstances which combined to allow the discovery of penicillin, one of which was Sir Alexander's choice to take a holiday with his family after leaving staphylococci bacteria in a culture in his lab before departure.  Anecdotally Sir Alexander was a little sloppy with lab hygiene which contributed to his previous discovery of lysozyme and it seems the same lack of care was partly responsible for the discovery of penicillin.  Lastly the specific location of his lab and cultures played a role - the fungal contaminant that had an anti-bacterial effect on the staphylococci culture came from Sir Alexander's colleagues lab one floor below"}]}

Others include Bob Odenkirk as Walter's and Jesse's lawyer Saul Goodman, Jonathan Banks as private investigator and fixer Mike Ehrmantraut, and Giancarlo Esposito as drug kingpin Gus Fring. The final season introduces Jesse Plemons as the criminally ambitious Todd Alquist, and Laura Fraser as Lydia Rodarte-Quayle, a cunning business executive secretly managing Walter's global meth sales for her company.\n\nBreaking Bad's first season received generally positive reviews, while the rest of its run received unanimous critical acclaim, with praise for the performances, direction, cinematography, screenplay, story, and character development. Since its conclusion, the show has been lauded by critics as one of the greatest television series of all time. It had fair viewership in its first three seasons, but the fourth and fifth seasons saw a moderate rise in viewership when it was made available on Netflix just before the fourth season premiere. Viewership increased more drastically upon the premiere of the second half of the fifth season in 2013. By the time that the series finale aired, it was among the most-watched cable shows on American television. The show received numerous awards, including 16 Primetime Emmy Awards, eight Satellite Awards, two Golden Globe Awards, two Peabody Awards, two Critics' Choice Awards, and four Television Critics Association Awards. Cranston won the Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Lead Actor in a Drama Series four times, while Aaron Paul won the Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Supporting Actor in a Drama Series three times; Anna Gunn won the Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Supporting Actress in a Drama Series twice. In 2013, Breaking Bad entered the Guinness World Records as the most critically acclaimed TV show of all time.\n\nThe series gave rise to the larger Breaking Bad franchise. Better Call Saul, a prequel series featuring Odenkirk, Banks, and Esposito reprising their Breaking Bad roles, as well as many others in guest and recurring appearances, debuted on AMC on February 8, 2015, and concluded on August 15, 2022.

The terminology \"back-propagating errors\" was introduced in 1962 by Frank Rosenblatt, but he did not know how to implement this, although Henry J. Kelley had a continuous precursor of backpropagation already in 1960 in the context of control theory. Modern backpropagation is actually Seppo Linnainmaa's general reverse mode of automatic differentiation (1970) for discrete connected networks of nested differentiable functions. It is an efficient application of the chain rule (derived by Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz in 1673) to networks of differentiable nodes. In 1982, Paul Werbos applied backpropagation to MLPs in the way that has become standard. In 1985, David E. Rumelhart et al. published an experimental analysis of the technique. Many improvements have been implemented in subsequent decades.\n\nDuring backpropagation, the output values are compared with the correct answer to compute the value of some predefined error-function. The error is then fed back through the network. Using this information, the algorithm adjusts the weights of each connection in order to reduce the value of the error function by some small amount. After repeating this process for a sufficiently large number of training cycles, the network will usually converge to some state where the error of the calculations is small. In this case, one would say that the network has learned a certain target function. To adjust weights properly, one applies a general method for non-linear optimization that is called gradient descent, due to Augustin-Louis Cauchy, who first suggested it in 1847. For this, the network calculates the derivative of the error function with respect to the network weights, and changes the weights such that the error decreases (thus going downhill on the surface of the error function). For this reason, back-propagation can only be applied on networks with differentiable activation functions.\nOutput:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Today, the most popular method for training multi-layer perceptrons (MLPs) is back-propagation.

A Democrat, Kennedy represented Massachusetts in both houses of the U.S. Congress prior to his presidency.\nOutput:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "John Fitzgerald Kennedy (May 29, 1917 \u2013 November 22, 1963), often referred to by his initials JFK, was an American politician who served as the 35th president of the United States from 1961 until his assassination in 1963. He was the youngest person to assume the presidency by election and the youngest president at the end of his tenure. Kennedy served at the height of the Cold War, and the majority of his foreign policy concerned relations with the Soviet Union and Cuba. A Democrat, Kennedy represented Massachusetts in both houses of the U.S. Congress prior to his presidency.\n\nBorn into the prominent Kennedy family in Brookline, Massachusetts, Kennedy graduated from Harvard University in 1940 before joining the U.S. Naval Reserve the following year. During World War II, he commanded a series of PT boats in the Pacific theater. Kennedy's survival following the sinking of PT-109 and his rescue of his fellow sailors made him a war hero and earned the Navy and Marine Corps Medal, but left him with serious injuries. After a brief stint in journalism, Kennedy represented a working-class Boston district in the U.S. House of Representatives from 1947 to 1953. He was subsequently elected to the U.S. Senate and served as the junior senator for Massachusetts from 1953 to 1960. While in the Senate, Kennedy published his book, Profiles in Courage, which won a Pulitzer Prize. Kennedy ran in the 1960 presidential election. His campaign gained momentum after the first televised presidential debates in American history, and he was elected president, narrowly defeating Republican opponent Richard Nixon, who was the incumbent vice president. He was the first Catholic elected president.\n\nKennedy's administration included high tensions with communist states in the Cold War. He increased the number of American military advisors in South Vietnam. He authorized numerous operations to overthrow the Cuban government of Fidel Castro, including the failed Bay of Pigs Invasion in April 1961. The following October, U.S. spy planes discovered Soviet missile bases in Cuba; the resulting period of tensions, termed the Cuban Missile Crisis, nearly resulted in the breakout of a global thermonuclear conflict. He also signed the first nuclear weapons treaty in October 1963. Kennedy presided over the establishment of the Peace Corps, Alliance for Progress with Latin America, and the continuation of the Apollo program with the goal of landing a man on the Moon. He also supported the civil rights movement but was only somewhat successful in passing his New Frontier domestic policies.\n\nOn November 22, 1963, Kennedy was assassinated in Dallas. His vice president, Lyndon B. Johnson, assumed the presidency upon Kennedy's death. Lee Harvey Oswald, a former U.S. Marine, was arrested for the assassination, but he was shot and killed by Jack Ruby two days later. The FBI and the Warren Commission both concluded Oswald had acted alone, but conspiracy theories about the assassination still persist. After Kennedy's death, Congress enacted many of his proposals, including the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and the Revenue Act of 1964. Kennedy ranks highly in polls of U.S. presidents with historians and the general public. His personal life has also been the focus of considerable sustained interest following public revelations in the 1970s of his chronic health ailments and extramarital affairs. Kennedy is the most recent U.S. president to have died in office."}]}

Many people were injured, including 138 police officers. Four officers who responded to the attack died by suicide within seven months. As of July 7, 2022, monetary damages caused by attackers exceed $2.7 million.\n\nCalled to action by Trump, thousands of his supporters gathered in Washington, D.C., on January 5 and 6 to support his false claim that the 2020 election had been \"stolen by emboldened radical-left Democrats\" and to demand that Vice President Mike Pence and the Congress reject Biden's victory. Starting at noon on January 6, at a \"Save America\" rally on the Ellipse, Trump repeated false claims of election irregularities and said \"If you don't fight like hell, you're not going to have a country anymore.\" In the same speech, he said \"I know that everyone here will soon be marching over to the Capitol building to peacefully and patriotically make your voices heard.\" During and after his speech, thousands of attendees, some armed, walked to the Capitol, and hundreds breached police perimeters as Congress was beginning the electoral vote count.\n\nMore than 2,000 rioters entered the building, many of whom occupied, vandalized, and looted; assaulted Capitol Police officers and reporters; and attempted to locate lawmakers to capture and harm. A gallows was erected west of the Capitol, and some rioters chanted \"Hang Mike Pence\" after he rejected false claims by Trump and others that the vice president could overturn the election results. Some vandalized and looted the offices of House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D\u2011CA) and other members of Congress. With building security breached, Capitol Police evacuated and locked down both chambers of Congress and several buildings in the Capitol Complex. Rioters occupied the empty Senate chamber while federal law enforcement officers defended the evacuated House floor. Pipe bombs were found at each of the Democratic National Committee and Republican National Committee headquarters, and Molotov cocktails were discovered in a vehicle near the Capitol.\n\nTrump resisted sending the National Guard to quell the mob. Later that afternoon, in a Twitter video, he reasserted that the election was \"fraudulent\", but told his supporters to \"go home in peace\". The Capitol was clear of rioters by mid-evening, and the counting of the electoral votes resumed and was completed in the early morning hours of January 7. Pence declared President-elect Biden and Vice President-elect Kamala Harris victorious. Pressured by his cabinet, the threat of removal, and many resignations, Trump later committed to an orderly transition of power in a televised statement.\n\nA week after the riot, the House of Representatives impeached Trump for incitement of insurrection, making him the only U.S. president to have been impeached twice. In February, after Trump had left office, the Senate voted 57\u201343 in favor of conviction; because this fell short of a two-thirds majority, requiring 67 votes, he was acquitted for a second time. The House passed a bill to create a bipartisan independent commission to investigate the attack, modeled after the 9/11 Commission, but it was blocked by Republicans in the Senate, so the House approved a select committee with seven Democrats and two Republicans to investigate instead. The committee held nine televised public hearings on the attack  in 2022, and later voted to subpoena Trump. By March 2022, the Justice Department's investigations had expanded to include the activities of others leading up to the attack. Ultimately, the Committee recommended Trump to DOJ to be prosecuted for obstructing an official proceeding, incitement, conspiracy to defraud the United States, and making false statements.\n\nMore than 30 members of anti-government groups, including the Oath Keepers, Proud Boys, and Three Percenters, were charged with conspiracy for allegedly planning their attacks on the Capitol; ten Oath Keepers and five Proud Boys were charged with seditious conspiracy, and one Oath Keeper pleaded guilty. Oath Keeper leader Stewart Rhodes would later be convicted of seditious conspiracy. As of January 2022, at least 57 people with roles in the day's events were running for public office. Although most people charged with crimes relating to the attack had no known affiliation with far-right or extremist groups, a significant number were linked to extremist groups or conspiratorial movements. By January 2023, at least 476 individuals charged had pleaded guilty."}]}

Some mid-size sedans and small SUVs can fit 3 car seats across the back row, but to fit them safely, you\u2019ll need to find the right set of thin car seats the meet the size requirements of your children (e.g. height and weight). For example, Clek makes narrow car seats. That said, taking a trip with 3 kids in these mid-size cars will be challenging unless you add a luggage rack to the top of your car. \n\nMid-size SUVs like the Honda Pilot, Kia Telluride, and the Toyota Highlander can accommodate wider car seats in their second row and even include a third row.

Output:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Wood expands and shrinks depending on its moisture content.  The relative amount of change, expansion, or shrinkage differs for each of the three main grain directions.  Those directions are longitudinal, radial, and tangential.  Longitudinal is the direction a tree or its branches grows length-wise.  In most lumber, this is its length.  The change in this direction is very small.  That is why a wooden ruler can be used without changing its measurements when ambient moisture changes.  In almost all uses, longitudinal expansion and contraction are small enough not to be of concern.  Radial and tangential directional expansion and contraction are significant and different enough that they affect the dimensional stability of a piece of wood.  The relative amount of change in each direction is specific to the wood species.  Regardless of wood species, the change is greater in the tangential direction than in the radial direction.  The tangential direction is tangential to the growth rings in the wood, and the radial direction is perpendicular to the growth rings.  The T/R or ratio of tangential to radial change correlates to the dimensional stability of a wood species.  If you visualize a piece of lumber that is milled square and comes from a part of a log such that the rings are almost straight across in one direction, that is referred to as vertical grain or quarter sawn.  As the moisture content of the wood changes to come into equilibrium with its environment, it will move toward a diamond shape.  The closer the T/R ratio is to 1, the less the square dimension will distort. Dimensional stability and the direction of wood movement is important to plan for when cutting joinery in wood.  If two joined pieces are aligned so that they will not move in the same direction relative to the joint, the joint will be unstable when the ambient humidity changes and can cause the joint to fail."}]}

Historian Ian Kershaw once wrote that \"trying to define 'fascism' is like trying to nail jelly to the wall. Each different group described as fascist has at least some unique elements, and many definitions of fascism have been criticized as either too broad or too narrow.\n\nFascism is a far-right, authoritarian, ultranationalist political ideology and movement characterized by a dictatorial leader, centralized autocracy, militarism, forcible suppression of opposition. Belief in a natural social hierarchy, subordination of individual interests for the perceived good of the nation and race, and strong regimentation of society and the economy. Since the end of World War II in 1945, few parties have openly described themselves as fascist; the term is more often used pejoratively by political opponents. The descriptions of neo-fascist or post-fascist are sometimes employed to describe contemporary parties with ideologies similar to, or rooted in, 20th-century fascist movements. \n\nThe first fascist movements emerged in Italy during World War I, before spreading to other European countries, most notably Germany. Fascism also had adherents outside of Europe. Fascists saw World War I as a revolution that brought massive changes to the nature of war, society, the state, and technology. Fascism rejects assertions that violence is inherently bad and views imperialism, political violence and war as means to national rejuvenation.

He was the first person to hold the office of vice president of the United States, serving from 1789 to 1797. Adams was a dedicated diarist and regularly corresponded with many important contemporaries, including his wife and adviser Abigail Adams as well as his friend and rival Thomas Jefferson.\n\nA lawyer and political activist prior to the Revolution, Adams was devoted to the right to counsel and presumption of innocence. He defied anti-British sentiment and successfully defended British soldiers against murder charges arising from the Boston Massacre. Adams was a Massachusetts delegate to the Continental Congress and became a leader of the revolution. He assisted Jefferson in drafting the Declaration of Independence in 1776. As a diplomat in Europe, he helped negotiate a peace treaty with Great Britain and secured vital governmental loans. Adams was the primary author of the Massachusetts Constitution in 1780, which influenced the United States constitution, as did his essay Thoughts on Government.\n\nAdams was elected to two terms as vice president under President George Washington and was elected as the United States' second president in 1796. He was the only president elected under the banner of the Federalist Party. During his single term, Adams encountered fierce criticism from the Jeffersonian Republicans and from some in his own Federalist Party, led by his rival Alexander Hamilton. Adams signed the controversial Alien and Sedition Acts, and built up the Army and Navy in the undeclared naval war (called the \"Quasi-War\") with France. During his term, he became the first president to reside in the executive mansion now known as the White House.\n\nIn his bid in 1800 for reelection to the presidency, opposition from Federalists and accusations of despotism from Jeffersonians led to Adams losing to his vice president and former friend Jefferson, and he retired to Massachusetts. He eventually resumed his friendship with Jefferson by initiating a correspondence that lasted fourteen years. He and his wife generated the Adams political family, a line of politicians, diplomats, and historians. It includes their son John Quincy Adams, the sixth president. John Adams died on July 4, 1826 \u2013 the fiftieth anniversary of the adoption of the Declaration of Independence \u2013 hours after Jefferson's death. Adams and his son are the only presidents of the first twelve who never owned slaves. Surveys of historians and scholars have favorably ranked his administration."}]}

The battle lasted for five weeks from 16 December 1944 to 28 January 1945, towards the end of the war in Europe. It was launched through the densely forested Ardennes region between Belgium and Luxembourg. It overlapped with the Alsace Offensive, subsequently the Colmar Pocket, another series of battles launched by the Germans in support of the Ardennes thrust.\n\nThe primary military objectives were to deny further use of the Belgian Port of Antwerp to the Allies and to split the Allied lines, which potentially could have allowed the Germans to encircle and destroy the four Allied forces. The Nazi dictator Adolf Hitler, who since December 1941 had assumed direct command of the German army, believed that achieving these objectives would compel the Western Allies to accept a peace treaty in the Axis powers' favor. By this time, it was palpable to virtually the entire German leadership including Hitler himself that they had no realistic hope of repelling the imminent Soviet invasion of Germany unless the Wehrmacht was able to concentrate the entirety of its remaining forces on the Eastern Front, which in turn obviously required that hostilities on the Western and Italian Fronts be terminated. The Battle of the Bulge remains among the most important battles of the war, as it marked the last major offensive attempted by the Axis Powers on the Western front. After their defeat, Germany would retreat for the remainder of the war.\n\nThe Germans achieved a total surprise attack on the morning of 16 December 1944, due to a combination of Allied overconfidence, preoccupation with Allied offensive plans, and poor aerial reconnaissance due to bad weather. American forces bore the brunt of the attack. The Germans attacked a weakly defended section of the Allied line, taking advantage of heavily overcast weather conditions that grounded the Allies' superior air forces. Fierce American resistance on the northern shoulder of the offensive, around Elsenborn Ridge, and in the south, around Bastogne, blocked German access to key roads to the northwest and west that they counted on for success. Columns of armor and infantry that were supposed to advance along parallel routes found themselves on the same roads. This congestion, and terrain that favored the defenders, threw the German advance behind schedule and allowed the Allies to reinforce the thinly placed troops.\n\nThe farthest west the offensive reached was the village of Foy-N\u00f4tre-Dame, south east of Dinant, being stopped by the U.S. 2nd Armored Division on 24 December 1944. Improved weather conditions from around 24 December permitted air attacks on German forces and supply lines, which sealed the failure of the offensive. On 26 December the lead element of Patton's U.S. Third Army reached Bastogne from the south, ending the siege. Although the offensive was effectively broken by 27 December, when the trapped units of 2nd Panzer Division made two break-out attempts with only partial success, the battle continued for another month before the front line was effectively restored to its position prior to the attack. In the wake of the defeat, many experienced German units were out of men and equipment, and the survivors retreated to the Siegfried Line.\n\nThe Germans' initial attack involved around 410,000 men; just over 1,400 tanks, tank destroyers, and assault guns; 2,600 artillery pieces; and over 1,000 combat aircraft, as well as large numbers of other armored fighting vehicles (AFVs). These were reinforced a couple of weeks later, bringing the offensive's total strength to around 450,000 troops, and 1,500 tanks and assault guns. Between 63,222 and 103,900 of these men were killed, missing, wounded in action, or captured. The battle severely depleted Germany's armored forces, which remained largely unreplaced throughout the remainder of the war. German Luftwaffe personnel, and later also Luftwaffe aircraft (in the concluding stages of the engagement) also sustained heavy losses.\n\nFrom among the Americans' peak strength of 610,000 troops there were 75,500 battle casualties, including about 8,400 killed. The \"Bulge\" was the largest and bloodiest single battle fought by the United States in World War II and the third-deadliest campaign in American history.\n\n"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "\u2022 The Battle of the Bulge, also known as the Ardennes Offensive, was the last major German offensive campaign on the Western Front during World War II.\n\u2022 The battle lasted for five weeks from 16 December 1944 to 28 January 1945, towards the end of the war in Europe.\n\u2022 The primary military objectives were to deny further use of the Belgian Port of Antwerp to the Allies and to split the Allied lines, which potentially could have allowed the Germans to encircle and destroy the four Allied forces.\n\u2022 The Germans achieved a total surprise attack on the morning of 16 December 1944, due to a combination of Allied overconfidence, preoccupation with Allied offensive plans, and poor aerial reconnaissance due to bad weather.\n\u2022 The farthest west the offensive reached was the village of Foy-N\u00f4tre-Dame, south east of Dinant, being stopped by the U.S. 2nd Armored Division on 24 December 1944.\n\u2022 On 26 December the lead element of Patton's U.S. Third Army reached Bastogne from the south, ending the siege.\n\u2022 The battle severely depleted Germany's armored forces, which remained largely unreplaced throughout the remainder of the war.\n\u2022 The \"Bulge\" was the largest and bloodiest single battle fought by the United States in World War II and the third-deadliest campaign in American history."}]}

The reverse sear is one of the most popular ways to grill a steak on the Big Green Egg, and my personal favorite. The key to the Reverse Sear is to start low and slow. It is much easier to raise the temp on the BGE than lower the temp. Ideally, the dome temp for a reverse sear is 250. However, I've had good success with the temp as low as 225 and as high as 300. \n\nFill your BGE up with your favorite lump charcoal up to the fire ring , light the fire and let it burn for about 9 minutes. Stir the coals so that the lit coals mix with unlit coals for an even cook.I prefer to cook my steak without adding wood chips as I don't want to overpower the meat...but if I were going to add chips I prefer post oak. Put the plate setter in with the legs up. Close the top and open the bottom vent and top vent with the opening about the size of a quarter. With the plate setter in, give it about 30 minutes to heat up the plate setter and stabilize at 250.\n\nNow that the Egg is stabilized at 250, time to add your steaks. You can pretty much reverse sear almost any cut but I prefer a ribeye, strip, or filet. The quintessential reverse sear cut is the bone-in ribeye, aka the cowboy or Tomahawk. The reverse sear works best with thick cuts. I would say the minimum thickness for a reverse sear is about 1 and a half inch, but the thicker the better. I look for the thickest cut possible for best results. I personally prefer to season my steaks with salt and pepper. My theory is that if you just spent $50 on a prime steak, then no need to overpower the meat with fancy seasoning. I want like the steaks to speak for themselves. The key to this stage is a good leave in thermometer. You want to roast the steaks until internal temp hits 113 degrees.  No more no less. When the internal temp hits 113, remove your steak to a cutting board and tent with foil.\n\t\nAt this point you should have pulled the steak with an internal temp of 113, and it should be resting on a tented cutting board. Final step of the reverse sear is the sear. Open up the top and remove the plate setter and grates.Open the bottom vent all the way and let the oxygen in to stoke the fire. I will give the coals another stir and about 5 minutes with the top open to gas up the fire. I then replace the grate, close the top and open all vents. The dome temp should climb rapidly. For a good sear you want it at least 450, with the ideal dome temp about 500-550. At this point you need to make a choice. You can either sear directly over the coals, or you can use a cast iron skillet with a butter bath. if you are going directly over the coals, its pretty simple. Place the steaks on the grate, and sear for about 90 seconds per side. If you use a cast iron skillet, I use a 50/50 mix of salted butter and olive oil. Butter has a lower scorch point, so if your skillet gets too hot you will burn the butter. I've also had good success with Avocado or Peanut oil that has a much higher scorch point. Add some garlic and thyme, sear for 90 seconds a side and don't forget to spoon the butter over the steaks for a little extra love. Remove the steaks and let them rest for 10 minutes. This is a critical step that will ensure the juices will stay in the meat.\n\nSlice and serve."}]}

One of the most significant changes is the decrease in muscle mass and strength. This loss of muscle mass is known as sarcopenia and can start as early as age 30, with a more rapid decline after age 60. This may lead many people to believe that gaining muscle after 35 is impossible, but is that really the case?\nYes, it's possible to build muscle after 35\n\nThe short answer is yes, it is possible to build muscle after 35. In fact, strength training can be just as effective for older adults as it is for younger ones. It's never too late to start working on your fitness goals and building the body you want.\n\nThe benefits of building muscle after 35\n\nAs we age, building muscle becomes increasingly important for several reasons. First and foremost, it can help us maintain our independence and mobility as we age. Strong muscles can help us with everyday activities like carrying groceries or getting up from a chair. Building muscle can also help prevent injuries and falls, which can be more dangerous as we get older.\n\nAdditionally, building muscle can help improve our overall health. Muscle is more metabolically active than fat, which means it burns more calories at rest. This can help us maintain a healthy weight and lower our risk of developing chronic diseases like type 2 diabetes, heart disease, and certain types of cancer.\n\nHow to build muscle after 35\n\nSo, how exactly do you go about building muscle after 35? The key is to focus on strength training exercises that target multiple muscle groups. Compound exercises like squats, deadlifts, and bench presses are great for building overall strength and muscle mass.\nIt's also important to gradually increase the weight and intensity of your workouts over time. This will help you continue to make progress and avoid plateauing. Additionally, be sure to give your muscles time to rest and recover between workouts.\n\nFinally, proper nutrition is crucial for building muscle at any age. Make sure you're getting enough protein, as this is essential for muscle growth and repair. Aim for at least 1 gram of protein per pound of body weight per day.\n\nBuilding muscle after 35 is definitely possible, and it comes with a variety of benefits. Strength training can help improve our overall health, prevent injury, and maintain our independence as we age. The key is to focus on compound exercises, gradually increase the intensity of your workouts, and make sure you're getting enough protein. So, what are you waiting for? It's time to hit the gym and start building the body you want!"}]}

As a recreational drone pilot you can capture and immortalize the incredible views experienced in nature while engaging in many outdoor activities. Many also engage in racing and building highly customized high speed drones using first person view (FPV) goggles to fly against other pilots in a close loop course. Before engaging in this fun and rewarding activity there are many rules that a drone pilot must be aware of in order to safely and legally operate your drone. These rules do not apply to racing drones in sanctioned races but do apply to all drones flown in public airspace.  All drones over 0.55lbs or 250g need to be registered through the FAA website and can not weigh over 55lbs.  If you plan to fly your drone over highly populated areas such as towns, sporting events, or concerts you will need to check local rules and ordinances that require special local licensing, insurance, or approvals.  Many higher end drones come with automated software that provides a geospatial mapping software in their interface that lets you know if you are flying in any restricted areas.  These include airports, helipads, government facilities, wildlife sanctuaries, etc.  All hobbyist drone pilots must follow two main rules.  You can never fly above 400 feet and regardless of range you must keep the drone within line of sight.  You are completely responsible for any damage your drone causes in the event of loss of control that results in a crash.  Lastly, use common sense and don\u2019t invade others' personal space or to invade others\u2019 personal privacy.  Staying within these guidelines can provide a joyful and rewarding experience for those who both fly and view the content produced by this hobby and will ensure our ability to do so into the future."}]}

Musical events bearing the Woodstock name were planned for anniversaries, which included the tenth, twentieth, twenty-fifth, thirtieth, fortieth, and fiftieth. In 2004, Rolling Stone magazine listed it as number 19 of the 50 Moments That Changed the History of Rock and Roll. In 2017, the festival site became listed on the National Register of Historic Places."}]}

The primary difference between these boats begins with the shape of the hull since many other design choices tend to be dictated by hull shape.\n\nCoastal cruisers, which are generally sailed near shore and in safer weather conditions, \ntend to have a flatter hull shapes since these boats, which means they tend to \"slap\" the water when coming off a wave.  With a flatter hull shape, boat architects can make greater use of the cabin space and so coastal cruisers will generally have a more spacious interior.  The helm (or the outdoor area from which the boat is navigated) is generally less protected and generally speaking, offers greater comfort and ease of moving around.  Safety, protection and expected time away from marinas mean these boats can refill fresh water, recharge batteries, empty waste tanks more frequently and therefore, tend to have lower capacities.\n\nBlue water boats, because they are intended to sail in open waters (hence the moniker \"blue water\") in more unpredictable weather, generally have tapered (or tear drop shaped) hull shapes with heavier keels (generally, lead) and deeper drafts.  With these designs, blue water boats can withstand heavier seas and will \"cut through\" waves rather than \"slap.\"  Generally speaking, blue water boats offer a much more comfortable experience in rougher seas and will have bigger fresh water and fuel tanks and will likely feature generators and other equipment that allows these boats to away for longer periods.\n\nBlue water boats feature tapered hulls so the beam or width of the boat narrows the closer it gets to the water line (and below), leaving less room in the interior cabin than an equally sized coastal cruiser.  Foot for foot, blue water boats will feature fewer berths and will have more cramped quarters because of the narrowing beam.\n\nBecause blue water boats are intended to sail longer distances and will carry more fuel and fresh water, these boats interior space is further restricted to accomadate these practical requirements.\n\nThe differences in comfort, stability and likelihood of capsizing are all captured in mathematical calculations that can provide an abstracted comparison between these boat types so prospective buyers can anticipate the the experiences and trade offs each hull type would provide."}]}

The weak force is the mechanism that is responsible for beta decay, while the other two are governed by the electromagnetism and nuclear force. A fourth type of common decay is electron capture, in which an unstable nucleus captures an inner electron from one of the electron shells. The loss of that electron from the shell results in a cascade of electrons dropping down to that lower shell resulting in emission of discrete X-rays from the transitions.

Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\n\n### Instruction:\nWhich countries today were commonly part of the Fertile Crescent in history?\n\n### Input:\nTraditional dried fruit such as raisins, figs, dates, apricots and apples have been a staple of Mediterranean diets for millennia. This is due partly to their early cultivation in the Middle Eastern region known as the Fertile Crescent, made up by parts of modern Iran, Iraq, southwest Turkey, Syria, Lebanon, Palestine, Israel, and northern Egypt. Drying or dehydration also happened to be the earliest form of food preservation: grapes, dates, and figs that fell from the tree or vine would dry in the hot sun. Early hunter-gatherers observed that these fallen fruit took on an edible form, and valued them for their stability as well as their concentrated sweetness. \nThe earliest recorded mention of dried fruits can be found in Mesopotamian tablets dating to about 1500 BC, which contain what are probably the oldest known written recipes. These clay slabs, written in Akkadian, the daily language of Babylonia, were inscribed in cuneiform and tell of diets based on grains (barley, millet, wheat), vegetables and fruits such as dates, figs, apples, pomegranates, and grapes. These early civilizations used dates, date juice evaporated into syrup and raisins as sweeteners. They included dried fruits in their breads for which they had more than 300 recipes, from simple barley bread for the workers to very elaborate, spiced cakes with honey for the palaces and temples.\nThe date palm was one of the first cultivated trees. It was domesticated in Mesopotamia more than 5,000 years ago. It grew abundantly in the Fertile Crescent and it was so productive (an average date palm produces 50 kg (100 lbs) of fruit a year for 60 years or more) that dates were the cheapest of staple foods. Because they were so valuable, they were well recorded in Assyrian and Babylonian monuments and temples. The villagers in Mesopotamia dried them and ate them as sweets. Whether fresh, soft-dried or hard-dried, they helped to give character to meat dishes and grain pies. They were valued by travelers for their energy and were recommended as stimulants against fatigue.\nFigs were also prized in early Mesopotamia, Palestine, Israel, and Egypt where their daily use was probably greater than or equal to that of dates. As well as appearing in wall paintings, many specimens have been found in Egyptian tombs as funerary offerings. In Greece and Crete, figs grew very readily and they were the staple of poor and rich alike, particularly in their dried form.\nGrape cultivation first began in Armenia and the eastern regions of the Mediterranean in the 4th century BC. Raisins were produced by drying grapes in the hot desert sun. Very quickly, viticulture and raisin production spread across northern Africa including Morocco and Tunisia. The Phoenicians and the Egyptians popularized the production of raisins, probably due to the perfect arid environment for sun drying. They put them in jars for storage and allotted them to the different temples by the thousands. They also added them to breads and various pastries, some made with honey, some with milk and eggs.\nFrom the Middle East, these fruits spread through Greece to Italy where they became a major part of the diet. Ancient Romans consumed raisins in spectacular quantities and at all levels of society, including them as a key part of their common meals, along with olives and fresh fruits. Raisined breads were common for breakfast and were consumed with their grains, beans, and cultured milks. Raisins were so valued that they transcended the food realm and became rewards for successful athletes, as well as premium barter currency.\nHaving dried fruits was essential in ancient Rome as these instructions for housekeepers around 100 BC tell: \"She must keep a supply of cooked food on hand for you and the servants. She must keep many hens and have plenty of eggs. She must have a large store of dried pears, sorbs, figs, raisins, sorbs in must, preserved pears and grapes and quinces. She must also keep preserved grapes in grape-pulp and in pots buried in the ground, as well as fresh Praenestine nuts kept in the same way, and Scantian quinces in jars, and other fruits that are usually preserved, as well as wild fruits. All these she must store away diligently every year.\"\nFigs were also extremely popular in Rome. Dried figs were added to bread and formed a major part of the winter food of country people. They were rubbed with spices such as cumin, anise and fennel seeds, or toasted sesame, wrapped in fig leaves and stored in jars. Today, major producing regions include Israel, Jerusalem, Gaza and many other Arabic countries. Dried figs are rich in vitamins, phosphorus and various other important minerals.\nPlums, apricots and peaches had their origins in Asia. They were domesticated in China in the 3rd millennium BC and spread to the Fertile Crescent where they were also very popular, fresh and dried alike. They arrived in Greece and Italy much later and were very expensive but valued in the preparation of gourmet dishes with port or stewed with honey and spices.\n\n### Response:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "The Middle Eastern region known as the Fertile Crescent, is made up by parts of modern Iran, Iraq, southwest Turkey, Syria, Lebanon, Palestine, Israel, and northern Egypt."}]}

A member of the Democratic Party, he previously served as the 47th vice president from 2009 to 2017 under President Barack Obama and represented Delaware in the United States Senate from 1973 to 2009.\n\nBorn in Scranton, Pennsylvania, Biden moved with his family to Delaware in 1953. He studied at the University of Delaware before earning his law degree from Syracuse University. He was elected to the New Castle County Council in 1970 and became the sixth-youngest senator in U.S. history after he was elected in 1972, at age 29. Biden was the chair or ranking member of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee for 12 years. He chaired the Senate Judiciary Committee from 1987 to 1995; drafted and led the effort to pass the Violent Crime Control and Law Enforcement Act and the Violence Against Women Act; and oversaw six U.S. Supreme Court confirmation hearings, including the contentious hearings for Robert Bork and Clarence Thomas. Biden ran unsuccessfully for the Democratic presidential nomination in 1988 and 2008. Barack Obama chose Biden as his running mate in the 2008 and 2012 presidential elections. Biden was a close counselor to Obama during his two terms as Obama's vice president.\n\nBiden and his running mate, Kamala Harris, defeated incumbents Donald Trump and Mike Pence in the 2020 presidential election. On January 20, 2021, he became the oldest president in U.S. history, the first to have a female vice president, and the first from Delaware. As president, Biden has addressed the COVID-19 pandemic and subsequent recession. He signed the American Rescue Plan Act, the bipartisan Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act, the Inflation Reduction Act, the CHIPS and Science Act, and the Respect for Marriage Act, which codified protections for same-sex marriage and repealed the Defense of Marriage Act. He appointed Ketanji Brown Jackson to the Supreme Court. In foreign policy, Biden restored America's membership in the Paris Agreement on climate change. He completed the withdrawal of U.S. troops from Afghanistan that had been negotiated and begun under the previous administration, ending the war in Afghanistan, during which the Afghan government collapsed and the Taliban seized control. He signed AUKUS, a security pact, together with Australia and the United Kingdom. He responded to the Russian invasion of Ukraine by imposing sanctions on Russia and authorizing foreign aid and weapons shipments to Ukraine."}]}

Promoters of the game have been calling it the \"fastest growing sport\" for some time now.\n\nThere are a few reasons many people cite for why the sport is so popular:\n\n- It is a quick game to learn.  The rules are pretty simple, and more importantly, the skill needed to hit functional shots in the game is not very difficult to learn.  Compare it to tennis, where it can take multiple lessons from a professional teacher just to get to a point where you can hit a few good shots.  With pickleball, almost anyone of any age or fitness level can pick up a paddle and be playing a game in just minutes.\n\n- Pickleball culture has tended to be very inclusive.  Many pickleball groups make it a point to be very inclusive of all ages, races and backgrounds.  This often creates a sense of community for players, and makes them more likely to keep playing and invite friends along, thus growing the sport.\n\n- It is a fun way to get in a decent workout.  While not as taxing as, say, tennis, pickleball can be a good workout.  Especially since unlike tennis there is very little downtime.  The pace of games is very quick and involves near constant movement.  The workout is not cardio-intensive, but still it is an easy way to have fun while staying active."}]}

A double shot of espresso amounts to 60ml in volume and this is added to with approximately 100ml of milk.  The process of steaming the milk modifies the proteins to create a thick foamy  consistency allowing baristas to create patterns on top of the milk from the brown of the coffee and white of the milk. This is often referred to as latte art.\n\nAlthough similar to a latte, the flat white has a stronger coffee flavour due the having a higher proportion of coffee to milk. The latte typically has a total volume of approximately 240ml compared to the 160ml in a flat white.  In addition, the foamy milk is thicker in a flat white giving it a \"flatter\" appearance.\n\nAlthough originating from the southern hemisphere, flat whites have gained global popularity and are now both a mainstay for specialist coffee shops as well as large  coffee shop chains such as Starbucks."}]}

Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\n\n### Instruction:\nFrom the passage provided, extract the date when the iPhone was announced publicly for the first time.\n\n### Input:\nDevelopment of an Apple smartphone began in 2004, when Apple started to gather a team of 1,000 employees led by hardware engineer Tony Fadell, software engineer Scott Forstall, and design officer Jony Ive, to work on the highly confidential \"Project Purple\".\n\nThen-Apple CEO Steve Jobs steered the original focus away from a tablet (which was later revisited in the form of the iPad) towards a phone. Apple created the device during a secretive collaboration with Cingular Wireless (later renamed AT&T Mobility) at the time\u2014at an estimated development cost of US$150 million over thirty months. According to Jobs in 1998, the \"i\" word in \"iMac\" (and therefore \"iPod\", \"iPhone\" and \"iPad\") stands for internet, individual, instruct, inform, and inspire.\n\nApple rejected the \"design by committee\" approach that had yielded the Motorola ROKR E1, a largely unsuccessful \"iTunes phone\" made in collaboration with Motorola. Among other deficiencies, the ROKR E1's firmware limited storage to only 100 iTunes songs to avoid competing with Apple's iPod nano. Cingular gave Apple the liberty to develop the iPhone's hardware and software in-house, a rare practice at the time, and paid Apple a fraction of its monthly service revenue (until the iPhone 3G), in exchange for four years of exclusive U.S. sales, until 2011.\n\nJobs unveiled the first-generation iPhone to the public on January 9, 2007, at the Macworld 2007 convention at the Moscone Center in San Francisco. The iPhone incorporated a 3.5-inch multi-touch display with few hardware buttons, and ran the iPhone OS operating system with a touch-friendly interface, then marketed as a version of Mac OS X. It launched on June 29, 2007, at a starting price of US$499 in the United States, and required a two-year contract with AT&T.\n\n\nWorldwide iPhone availability:\n  iPhone available since its original release\n  iPhone available since the release of iPhone 3G\nOn July 11, 2008, at Apple's Worldwide Developers Conference (WWDC) 2008, Apple announced the iPhone 3G, and expanded its launch-day availability to twenty-two countries, and it was eventually released in 70 countries and territories. The iPhone 3G introduced faster 3G connectivity, and a lower starting price of US$199 (with a two-year AT&T contract). Its successor, the iPhone 3GS, was announced on June 8, 2009, at WWDC 2009, and introduced video recording functionality.\n\n\nFirst iPhone on display under glass at the January 2007 Macworld show\nThe iPhone 4 was announced on June 7, 2010, at WWDC 2010, and introduced a redesigned body incorporating a stainless steel frame and a rear glass panel. At release, the iPhone 4 was marketed as the \"world's thinnest smartphone\"; it uses the Apple A4 processor, being the first iPhone to use an Apple custom-designed chip. It introduced the Retina display, having four-times the display resolution of preceding iPhones, and was the highest-resolution smartphone screen at release; a front-facing camera was also introduced, enabling video calling functionality via FaceTime.\n\nUsers of the iPhone 4 reported dropped/disconnected telephone calls when holding their phones in a certain way, and this issue was nicknamed \"antennagate\". In January 2011, as Apple's exclusivity agreement with AT&T was expiring, Verizon announced that they would be carrying the iPhone 4, with a model compatible with Verizon's CDMA network releasing on February 10\n\n### Response:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Then-Apple CEO Steve Jobs publicly announced the first-generation iPhone on January 9, 2007, at the Macworld 2007 convention at the Moscone Center in San Francisco."}]}

The difference is that ultimate frisbee is a team sport that combines several of the rules of football, basketball and soccer. Like football, a team takes possession of the frisbee and tries to move it down field and into an end zone. Like basketball, once you are in possession of the frisbee, you cannot move your pivot foot. However, there is no \"dribbling\" with a frisbee so if a player has possession of the frisbee outside of their end zone, they have to pass it before they can move their pivot foot. Ultimate frisbee is played on a soccer field and the player movement looks most like that sport. Frisbee golf, on the other hand, follows the rules of golf, except that the player throws a frisbee to the hole instead of hitting a ball with clubs. Some people play the sport on dedicated frisbee golf courses, using a set of specialized discs of various weights and carrying them in a bag from hole to hole like a golfer would do with their set of clubs. Others simply take a standard 175-gram frisbee and make up a course as they go. For example, two players might point to a tree on the other side of a park and compete by seeing who can hit the tree with a frisbee in the fewest consecutive attempts."}]}

His films are among the 100 highest-grossing movies at the North American box office, adjusted for ticket-price inflation. Lucas is considered to be one of the most significant figures of the 20th-century New Hollywood movement, and a pioneer of the modern blockbuster.\n\nAfter graduating from the University of Southern California in 1967, Lucas co-founded American Zoetrope with filmmaker Francis Ford Coppola. Lucas wrote and directed THX 1138 (1971), based on his student short Electronic Labyrinth: THX 1138 4EB, which was a critical success but a financial failure. His next work as a writer-director was American Graffiti (1973), inspired by his youth in the early 1960s Modesto, California, and produced through the newly founded Lucasfilm. The film was critically and commercially successful and received five Academy Award nominations, including Best Director and Best Picture.\n\nLucas's next film, the epic space opera Star Wars (1977), had a troubled production but was a surprise hit, becoming the highest-grossing film at the time, winning six Academy Awards and sparking a cultural phenomenon. Lucas produced and co-wrote the sequels The Empire Strikes Back (1980) and Return of the Jedi (1983). With director Steven Spielberg, he created, produced, and co-wrote the Indiana Jones films Raiders of the Lost Ark (1981), The Temple of Doom (1984), The Last Crusade (1989), and The Kingdom of the Crystal Skull (2008), and only produced The Dial of Destiny (2023). Lucas is also known for his collaboration with composer John Williams, who was recommended to him by Spielberg, and with whom he has worked for all the films in both of these franchises. He also produced and wrote a variety of films and television series through Lucasfilm between the 1970s and the 2010s.\n\nIn 1997, Lucas re-released the original Star Wars trilogy as part of a Special Edition featuring several modifications; home media versions with further changes were released in 2004 and 2011. He returned to directing with a Star Wars prequel trilogy comprising Star Wars: Episode I \u2013 The Phantom Menace (1999), Episode II \u2013 Attack of the Clones (2002), and Episode III \u2013 Revenge of the Sith (2005).

You could try Sketch in Mayfair or The Savoy in Covent Garden for completely different experiences \u2014 Sketch is definitely a millennial\u2019s take on tea and it\u2019s very trendy, whereas The Savoy is more traditional.\n\nGrab a drink. You might think of dark pubs when you think of London, but it is also home to some of the best cocktail bars in the world. For a unique experience, find a \"public bathroom bar\" or a speakeasy like Keystone Crescent Members Club. Shoreditch has plenty of options for the imbibers, like Ace Hotel Rooftop and Old St Records. Then there's Duke's Bar in Mayfair, which is a famous spot for a martini since Ian Fleming used to hang out there when he was writing James Bond novels.\n\nVisit a museum. The Tate Modern offers free entry and an excellent view of the city. It's on the south side of the Thames, and you can wander from there to the Shakespeare Globe. The National Portrait Gallery will keep you entertained, even though it really is home to all portraits, but you can learn a lot about British history by reading through the biographies of public figures featured. I also recommend seeing which artist's work the Hayward Gallery at the Southbank Centre is exhibiting, since it's an excellent space. The Tower of London is a classic for visitors: the castle is a World Heritage Site and where you need to go if you want to admire the Crown Jewels.\n\nSee a show. If you live or often see Broadway shows in New York, this might be less exciting to you, but London shows are relatively easy to secure tickets for, and a great activity if you're interested in experiencing even more British culture.\n\nShop. Don't miss the famous Harrod's, the iconic department store with a iconic food floor. Liberty is another well-known London department store. Less expensive, and known for their stationary. And if department stores aren't your thing, pop into local boutiques!"}]}

It was after the time of enlightenment in 1876 that the eomuk tang (fish cake soup) was brought to Korea. It entered Korea at the port of Bu-san and became a widespread Korean street food. As the home of fish cake history, Busan boasts that its fish cake is the best in Korea.\tEomuk-kkochi.jpg\nHotteok\tHotteok is a traditional street food in South Korea.

It can be found both on the street and at convenience stores.\tHoppang (inside).jpg\nTteokbokki\tTteokbokki is stir-fried rice cake, a traditional Korean food. There is a history of food similar to tteokbokki in a book called '\u98df\u7642\u7e82\u8981' compiled at the time of Chosun, Sejo in 1460. Before kochujang tteokbokki, there was food similar to tteokbokki in the old court. In the 1800s cookbook \"\u662f\u8b70\u5168\u66f8\", there is a record that \"I ate white rice cake with beef sirloin, soy sauce, onion, rice cake and so on.\" It re-emerged in the late 1960s, with a Kochujang (red chili paste) sauce.\tTteok-bokki.jpg\nGyeran-ppang\tGyeran-ppang (egg bread) is a warm street snack sold throughout South Korea.

Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\n\n### Instruction:\nhow many strings guitar have?\nhow guitar projects sound?\nwhat are different types of guitar?\n\n### Input:\nThe guitar is a fretted musical instrument that typically has six strings. It is usually held flat against the player's body and played by strumming or plucking the strings with the dominant hand, while simultaneously pressing selected strings against frets with the fingers of the opposite hand. A plectrum or individual finger picks may also be used to strike the strings. The sound of the guitar is projected either acoustically, by means of a resonant chamber on the instrument, or amplified by an electronic pickup and an amplifier.\n\nThe guitar is classified as a chordophone \u2013 meaning the sound is produced by a vibrating string stretched between two fixed points. Historically, a guitar was constructed from wood with its strings made of catgut. Steel guitar strings were introduced near the end of the nineteenth century in the United States, nylon strings came in the 1940s. The guitar's ancestors include the gittern, the vihuela, the four-course Renaissance guitar, and the five-course baroque guitar, all of which contributed to the development of the modern six-string instrument.\n\nThere are three main types of modern guitar: the classical guitar (Spanish guitar/nylon-string guitar), the steel-string acoustic guitar or electric guitar, and the Hawaiian guitar (played across the player's lap). Traditional acoustic guitars include the flat top guitar (typically with a large sound hole) or an arch top guitar, which is sometimes called a \"jazz guitar\". The tone of an acoustic guitar is produced by the strings' vibration, amplified by the hollow body of the guitar, which acts as a resonating chamber. The classical Spanish guitar is often played as a solo instrument using a comprehensive fingerstyle technique where each string is plucked individually by the player's fingers, as opposed to being strummed. The term \"finger-picking\" can also refer to a specific tradition of folk, blues, bluegrass, and country guitar playing in the United States.\n\n### Response:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "A typical guitar have 6 strings but there are other guitars (bass guitar) which have 4-6 strings.\nThe sound of the guitar is projected either acoustically, by means of a resonant chamber on the instrument, or amplified by an electronic pickup and an amplifier.\nThere are three main types of modern guitar, the classical guitar, the steel string acoustic guitar or electric guitar, and the Hawaiian guitar which is played across player's lap."}]}

The club was founded in 2008 and first took the pitch in 2010. Since 2017, the Rowdies have been members of the USL Championship in the second tier of the American soccer pyramid. They formerly played in USSF Division 2 (in 2010) and the North American Soccer League (NASL) (from 2011 to 2016), which were also second-tier leagues. The Rowdies play their home games at Al Lang Stadium on St. Petersburg's downtown waterfront.\n\nThe current club is a phoenix club of the original Tampa Bay Rowdies, who were active from 1975 until 1993, most notably in the original North American Soccer League. It shares its name, logo, and some of its club culture with the original club. The owners of the current club announced their intention to use the old Rowdies' trademarks at its introductory press conference in 2008. However, licensing issues forced the club to use the name FC Tampa Bay until December 2011, when it gained full rights to the Rowdies name and other intellectual property. The current Rowdies have always used the same green and yellow color scheme and \"hoops\" as the original team, even when they could not yet use the Rowdies name.\n\nThe Rowdies captured the NASL championship in Soccer Bowl 2012, and their team shield includes two stars: one for their 2012 win and one for the 1975 Soccer Bowl championship won by the original Rowdies. The club has had a long-standing rivalry with the Fort Lauderdale Strikers, with whom they have contested the Florida Derby since the original Rowdies and Strikers first met in 1977. The Rowdies were also named co-league champions in 2020 after winning the USL Regular Season title and Eastern Conference Championship, but the title game was canceled due to COVID-19. They were Eastern Conference Champions again in 2021, but lost in the title game.\n\nIn October 2018, the Tampa Bay Rays, the area's Major League Baseball franchise, announced plans to purchase the Rowdies and assume control of Al Lang Stadium.\n\n### Response:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "The Tampa Bay Rowdies wear green and yellow and play in Al Lang Stadium in downtown St. Petersburg."}]}

To understand this, just think of a prism.  White light enters, and a rainbow of colors exits. Our sun is like that. Its light may seem uniform but it is actually emitting many different colors.\n\nOur sky though is not a mix of blue and red and green because the earth's atmosphere is sandwiched between the sun and us, getting in the way. Atmospheric gases and particles scatter the incoming colors, bouncing them in all different directions.  The amount of scattering increases as the wavelength of light decreases.  Red light which has a long wavelength is scattered much less than blue light which has a short wavelength. As blue is scattered more, it fills our daytime sky.\n\nAs the sun traverses the sky and moves low on the horizon, the light that reaches our eyes must actually travel further through the atmosphere.  This has the effect of completely bouncing away all the blue light.  We are left with the reds and yellows and oranges in wonderful mixture, making sunrises and sunsets so beautiful."}]}

If an adversary can find a ship on the open ocean and target it with a modern anti-ship missile, this opponent can certainly destroy the complex machinery needed to operate a container port or an oil terminal. Consequently, any cargo you want to unload in a war zone is going to need to drive off a ship on the back of a truck....quickly. An oil tanker will be useless, but a RO/RO ship loaded with tanker trucks can unload lots of fuel under austere/wartime conditions. Similarly, a container ship will be of little use without the large, land-based cranes used at most container shipping ports. A ferry loaded with trucks hauling shipping containers can quickly load and unload without the need for specialized equipment. Data from the Iran-Iraq war suggest that a large, 50,000+ ton RO/RO with a double hull is likely big enough to survive a hit from a modern anti-ship missile. A fast ferry that can move at ~40 knots is probably going to be too small to detect from space or shore using backscatter radar. Conversely, a 100,000-ton PanMax oil tanker or a 5,000 TEU container ship will be easy to detect, and slow enough to target."}]}

Plasma is very uncommon on Earth (except for the ionosphere), although it is the most common state of matter in the universe.\nSupercritical fluid: At sufficiently high temperatures and pressures, the distinction between liquid and gas disappears.\nDegenerate matter: matter under very high pressure, supported by the Pauli exclusion principle.\nElectron-degenerate matter: found inside white dwarf stars. Electrons remain bound to atoms but can transfer to adjacent atoms.\nNeutron-degenerate matter: found in neutron stars. Vast gravitational pressure compresses atoms so strongly that the electrons are forced to combine with protons via Inverse beta decay, resulting in a super dense conglomeration of neutrons. (Normally free neutrons outside an atomic nucleus will decay with a half-life of just under fifteen minutes, but in a neutron star, as in the nucleus of an atom, other effects stabilize the neutrons.)\nStrange matter: A type of quark matter that may exist inside some neutron stars close to the Tolman\u2013Oppenheimer\u2013Volkoff limit (approximately 2\u20133 solar masses). May be stable at lower energy states once formed.\nQuantum spin Hall state: a theoretical phase that may pave the way for developing electronic devices that dissipate less energy and generate less heat. This is a derivation of the quantum Hall state of matter.\nBose\u2013Einstein condensate: a phase in which a large number of bosons all inhabit the same quantum state, in effect becoming one single wave/particle. This is a low-energy phase that can only be formed in laboratory conditions and at very low temperatures. It must be close to zero kelvin, or absolute zero. Satyendra Nath Bose and Albert Einstein predicted the existence of such a state in the 1920s, but it was not observed until 1995 by Eric Cornell and Carl Wieman.\nFermionic condensate: Similar to the Bose-Einstein condensate but composed of fermions, also known as Fermi-Dirac condensate. The Pauli exclusion principle prevents fermions from entering the same quantum state, but a pair of fermions can behave like a boson, and multiple such pairs can then enter the same quantum state without restriction.\nSuperconductivity: is a phenomenon of exactly zero electrical resistance and expulsion of magnetic fields occurring in certain materials when cooled below a characteristic critical temperature. Superconductivity is the ground state of many elemental metals.\nSuperfluid: A phase achieved by a few cryogenic liquids at extreme temperature at which they become able to flow without friction. A superfluid can flow up the side of an open container and down the outside. Placing a superfluid in a spinning container will result in quantized vortices.\nSupersolid: similar to a superfluid, a supersolid can move without friction but retains a rigid shape.\nQuantum spin liquid: A disordered state in a system of interacting quantum spins which preserves its disorder to shallow temperatures, unlike other disordered states.\nString-net liquid: Atoms in this state have unstable arrangements, like a liquid, but are still consistent in the overall pattern, like a solid.\nTime crystals: A state of matter where an object can have movement even at its lowest energy state.\nRydberg polaron: A state of matter that can only exist at ultra-low temperatures and consists of atoms inside of atoms.\nBlack superionic ice: A state of matter that can exist under very high pressure while excited by super lasers.\nOutput:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "1. Plasma: Plasma is the most common state of matter in the universe, but it is uncommonly found on Earth. This state of matter is comprised of free charged particles, such as ions and electrons. Similar to a gaseous state, however, it may generate a magnetic field. \n2. Supercritical fluid: Matter that lacks a clear distinction between being a gas and a liquid. This state is found at high temperatures and pressures.\n3. Degenerative Matter: A highly dense state of matter due to very high pressures. This state of matter is naturally found in stars in their final evolutionary states. \n4. Bose-Einstein condensate: A phase of matter in which a large number of bosons all inhabit the same quantum state. This phase requires temperatures near absolute zero of very low density gas.\n5. Fermionic condensate: Similar to Bose-Einstein condensate, except with fermions instead of bosons. \n6. Superconductivity: Certain elemental materials may achieve a ground state of superconductivity where there is no electrical resistance and magnetic flux fields are expelled. While most conductors will have reduced resistance as the temperature is lowered, superconductors will abruptly achieve zero resistance at a certain critical temperature. \n7. Superfluid: Some fluids may enter this state of matter where, at extremely low temperatures, they become able to flow without friction.\n8. Supersolid: Similar to a superfluid, except it can move without friction in a rigid, solid shape.\n9. Quantum spin liquid: A state of matter found in certain materials related to the quantum spin. In most magnetic materials, spins tend to form patterns based on how they interact with other neighboring spins. In a quantum spin liquid, however, they remain in a disordered state, never forming a pattern that prevents it from reaching a stable, ordered state.\n10. String-net liquid: Atoms in this state have a consistent overall pattern like a solid, but their arrangement is unstable.\n11. Time crystals: A quantum system of particles that exhibits non-kinetic motion of particles at their lowest-energy state. \n12. Rydberg polaron: An exotic state of matter created at low temperatures in which a very large atom contains other ordinary atoms between the nucleus and electrons. \n13. Black superionic ice: This matter is a phase of water that exists at extremely high pressures and temperatures."}]}

A couple of ways to make friends are: \n1. Visit your neighborhood bar and sit at the bar. More than likely there will be other folks going alone and you'll be able to chat with them. You can strike a conversation by easily asking them about their order or if they're from the area. \n2. Join travel groups on Facebook, Instagram and TikTok. With social media, it's much easier to find people who are traveling in the same location as you are and willing to meet up. A great group is The Travel Squad. You can join their Facebook community with thousands of solo travelers \n3. Do walking tours! There are a ton of free walking tours that you can do so make sure to sign up. \n4. Excursions is another great way to meet others. Don't be afraid to ask people where they are from or what got them interested in doing that excursion. \n5. Hostels. If you don't mind the noise levels, hostels are one of the top ways to meet fellow friends while solo traveling. They always host great music, events and have a common dining room area where people tend to hang out. \n\nTraveling alone can feel scary but remember that all it takes is getting out of your comfort zone and striking up a conversation to make long lasting friendships!"}]}

She was nominated by President Bill Clinton to replace retiring justice Byron White, and at the time was generally viewed as a moderate consensus-builder. She eventually became part of the liberal wing of the Court as the Court shifted to the right over time. Ginsburg was the first Jewish woman and the second woman to serve on the Court, after Sandra Day O'Connor. During her tenure, Ginsburg wrote majority opinions, including United States v. Virginia (1996), Olmstead v. L.C. (1999), Friends of the Earth, Inc. v. Laidlaw Environmental Services, Inc. (2000), and City of Sherrill v.

Virginia (1996), Olmstead v. L.C. (1999), Friends of the Earth, Inc. v. Laidlaw Environmental Services, Inc. (2000), and City of Sherrill v. Oneida Indian Nation of New York (2005).\n\nGinsburg was born and grew up in Brooklyn, New York. Her older sister died when she was a baby, and her mother died shortly before Ginsburg graduated from high school. She earned her bachelor's degree at Cornell University and married Martin D. Ginsburg, becoming a mother before starting law school at Harvard, where she was one of the few women in her class. Ginsburg transferred to Columbia Law School, where she graduated joint first in her class. During the early 1960s she worked with the Columbia Law School Project on International Procedure, learned Swedish, and co-authored a book with Swedish jurist Anders Bruzelius; her work in Sweden profoundly influenced her thinking on gender equality. She then became a professor at Rutgers Law School and Columbia Law School, teaching civil procedure as one of the few women in her field.\n\nGinsburg spent much of her legal career as an advocate for gender equality and women's rights, winning many arguments before the Supreme Court. She advocated as a volunteer attorney for the American Civil Liberties Union and was a member of its board of directors and one of its general counsel in the 1970s. In 1980, President Jimmy Carter appointed her to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit, where she served until her appointment to the Supreme Court in 1993. Between O'Connor's retirement in 2006 and the appointment of Sonia Sotomayor in 2009, she was the only female justice on the Supreme Court. During that time, Ginsburg became more forceful with her dissents, such as with Ledbetter v. Goodyear Tire & Rubber Co. (2007). Ginsburg's dissenting opinion was credited with inspiring the Lilly Ledbetter Fair Pay Act which was signed into law by President Barack Obama in 2009, making it easier for employees to win pay discrimination claims. Ginsburg received attention in American popular culture for her passionate dissents in numerous cases, widely seen as reflecting paradigmatically liberal views of the law. She was dubbed \"The Notorious R.B.G.\", and she later embraced the moniker.\n\nDespite two bouts with cancer and public pleas from liberal law scholars, she decided not to retire in 2013 or 2014 when Obama and a Democratic-controlled Senate could appoint and confirm her successor. Ginsburg died at her home in Washington, D.C., on September 18, 2020, at the age of 87, from complications of metastatic pancreatic cancer. The vacancy created by her death was filled 39 days later by Amy Coney Barrett, a conservative. The result was one of three major rightward shifts in the Court since 1953, following the appointment of Clarence Thomas to replace Thurgood Marshall in 1991 and the appointment of Warren Burger to replace Earl Warren in 1969."}]}

Gaining an early following as one of the first British psychedelic groups, they were distinguished by their extended compositions, sonic experimentation, philosophical lyrics and elaborate live shows. They became a leading band of the progressive rock genre, cited by some as the greatest progressive rock band of all time.\n\nPink Floyd were founded in 1965 by Syd Barrett (guitar, lead vocals), Nick Mason (drums), Roger Waters (bass guitar, vocals), and Richard Wright (keyboards, vocals). Under Barrett's leadership, they released two charting singles and the successful debut album The Piper at the Gates of Dawn (1967). The guitarist and vocalist David Gilmour joined in January 1968; Barrett left in April 1968 due to deteriorating mental health. Waters became the primary lyricist and thematic leader, devising the concepts behind Pink Floyd's most successful albums, The Dark Side of the Moon (1973), Wish You Were Here (1975), Animals (1977) and The Wall (1979). The musical film based on The Wall, Pink Floyd \u2013 The Wall (1982), won two BAFTA Awards. Pink Floyd also composed several film scores.\n\nFollowing personal tensions, Wright left Pink Floyd in 1981, followed by Waters in 1985. Gilmour and Mason continued as Pink Floyd, rejoined later by Wright. They produced the albums A Momentary Lapse of Reason (1987) and The Division Bell (1994), backed by major tours, before entering a long hiatus. In 2005, all but Barrett reunited for a performance at the global awareness event Live 8. Barrett died in 2006, and Wright in 2008. The last Pink Floyd studio album, The Endless River (2014), was based on unreleased material from the Division Bell recording sessions. In 2022, Gilmour and Mason reformed Pink Floyd to release the song \"Hey, Hey, Rise Up!\" in protest of the Russo-Ukrainian War.\n\nBy 2013, Pink Floyd had sold more than 250 million records worldwide, making them one of the best-selling music artists of all time. The Dark Side of the Moon and The Wall were inducted into the Grammy Hall of Fame, and these albums and Wish You Were Here are among the best-selling albums of all time. Four Pink Floyd albums topped the US Billboard 200, and five topped the UK Albums Chart. Pink Floyd's hit singles include \"See Emily Play\" (1967), \"Money\" (1973), \"Another Brick in the Wall, Part 2\" (1979), \"Not Now John\" (1983), \"On the Turning Away\" (1987) and \"High Hopes\" (1994). They were inducted into the US Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1996 and the UK Music Hall of Fame in 2005. In 2008, Pink Floyd were awarded the Polar Music Prize in Sweden for their contribution to modern music.\n\n"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "The last album of Pink Floyd was called \"The Endless River\" and was released in 2014."}]}

We are thinking of buying a pet. What are some good pet options for our family of four? Please include some advantages and disadvantages for each option.\n"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Congratulations on your growing family! Pets are often treated like another member of the family and while they can require a lot of work, they can also bring a lot of joy and laughter into your life.\n\nHere are a few options for pets and some advantages and disadvantages for each:\n\n1. Dogs - Dogs can be amazing pets. They are typically very loyal, friendly, and beloved by families all over the world. Dogs can be taught to do tricks like sit, stay, and fetch. There are also over 300 different breeds of dog and they come in all kinds of sizes, ranging from a few lbs (1-2 kg) to over 150 lbs (70 kg). Dogs require quite a bit of work to train and can be very expensive to own due to high veterinary bills. Some dogs can be aggressive, and this is an important factor to consider given that you have two young children. Dogs also typically require access to a yard or regular walking to ensure that they are not going to the bathroom inside. Also, many people are allergic to dogs due to the fact that most dogs shed. If your family members are prone to allergies and are still looking to add a dog to the family, perhaps you should consider a hypoallergenic breed like a Yorkshire Terrier, poodle, or a poodle mix like a Golden Doodle. Dogs typically live between 7-15 years, depending on the breed. \n\n2. Cats - Cats are another very popular pet option for families. Like dogs, they come in many different breed options but there are far fewer breed options for cats than dogs. Most cats grow to be about 10 lbs (4 kg), but they can range in size from around 5 lbs (2 kg) to 25 lbs (11 kg). Indoor cats typically live between 12-18 years. Cats typically require far less work and are generally more independent than dogs. While most cats can't be trained to do tricks, cats are often lower maintenance than dogs. Cats can often be left alone at the house for a long time. Most cats use a litter box to relieve themselves so they typically don't need regular walks or access to a yard. Like dogs, most cats shed, so allergies and cleaning pet dander can be a nuisance. Cats typically eat less than dogs and often are less expensive to own.\n\n3. Fish - Fish are a popular pet option for families that are looking for a very low maintenance pet that only requires feeding a couple of times per day. Fish typically require water, a clean fish tank and fish food, and that's about it. Some pet fish, like goldfish, can be bought for as little as $10, while exotic fish can cost hundreds or even thousands of dollars. Most pet fish will live up to 2 years if properly cared for, but certain species can live up to 30 years. \n\n4. Reptiles - Reptiles like snakes, lizards, or iguanas can also be pets. They typically require low maintenance and can live for up to 20-30 years. They require a cage, regular feeding, and are generally easy to take care of. For medical emergencies, they may require specialized veterinarians or doctor's, which can be hard to find.\n\n5. Rodents - rodents like gerbils, hamsters and even mice can be pets as well. They require regular feeding and a small cage, and are typically very easy to take care of. People often include a running wheel in the cage for these small animals so that they can exercise. However, they don't live very long; most rodents only live for a couple of years at most. \n\nIn addition to the list above, there are many other options for pets such as guinea pigs, rabbits, pigs and even exotic options like monkeys. Depending on where you live, there may be certain restrictions on the types of pets that you can own. Please be sure to check with these restrictions before buying your family pet."}]}

She was one of the most influential professors in commercial and bankruptcy law before beginning her political career. Warren has written 12 books and more than 100 articles.\n\nWarren's first foray into public policy began in 1995, when she worked to oppose what eventually became a 2005 act restricting bankruptcy access for individuals. During the late 2000s, her national profile grew after her forceful public stances in favor of more stringent banking regulations after the financial crisis of 2007\u201308. She served as chair of the Congressional Oversight Panel of the Troubled Asset Relief Program, and proposed and established the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, for which she served as the first special advisor under President Barack Obama.\n\nIn 2012, Warren defeated incumbent Republican Scott Brown and became the first female U.S. senator from Massachusetts. She won re-election by a wide margin in 2018, defeating Republican nominee Geoff Diehl. On February 9, 2019, Warren announced her candidacy in the 2020 United States presidential election.

At the end of the turn, you want to bring your feet forward and aim to have at least half of the pressure just in front of the heel of the foot, this will allow the edge along the tail of the ski to bite into the snow.\n\nIf you have too much pressure on the uphill foot, for example, you are leaning up the hill or transferred your weight too early onto the new downhill foot, that can also cause your current downhill foot to not get enough grip and washout. Try have majority of your weight on your downhill foot until the turn is finished before transferring majority of the weight to the new downhill foot.\n\nIt will also be helpful to find a good ski instructor at your local resort or online to look at your skiing and provide feedback."}]}

Her genre-spanning discography, songwriting and artistic reinventions have received critical praise and wide media coverage. Born in West Reading, Pennsylvania, Swift moved to Nashville at age 14 to become a country artist. She signed a songwriting deal with Sony/ATV Music Publishing in 2004 and a recording contract with Big Machine Records in 2005. Her 2006 self-titled debut album made her the first female country singer to write a U.S. platinum-certified album.\n\nSwift's next albums, Fearless (2008) and Speak Now (2010), explored country pop. The former's \"Love Story\" and \"You Belong with Me\" were the first country songs to top the U.S. pop and all-genre airplay charts, respectively. She experimented with rock and electronic styles on Red (2012), which featured her first Billboard Hot 100 number-one song, \"We Are Never Ever Getting Back Together\", and eschewed her country image in her synth-pop album, 1989 (2014), supported by chart-topping songs \"Shake It Off\", \"Blank Space\", and \"Bad Blood\". Media scrutiny inspired the urban-flavored Reputation (2017) and its number-one single \"Look What You Made Me Do\".\n\nExiting Big Machine, Swift signed with Republic Records in 2018 and released her seventh studio album, Lover (2019), followed by the autobiographical documentary Miss Americana (2020). She ventured into indie folk and alternative rock in her 2020 albums Folklore and Evermore, whose singles \"Cardigan\" and \"Willow\" topped the Hot 100. Swift began re-recording her first six albums after a dispute over their masters, re-releasing two in 2021\u2014Fearless (Taylor's Version) and Red (Taylor's Version). The latter's \"All Too Well (10 Minute Version)\" became the longest song to top the Hot 100. Her 2022 album Midnights and single \"Anti-Hero\" broke all-time streaming records. Swift has directed music videos and films, such as All Too Well: The Short Film (2021), and played supporting roles in others.\n\nHaving sold over 200 million records globally, Swift is one of the best-selling musicians in history. She is the most streamed woman on Spotify, and the only act to have five albums open with over one million copies sold in the US. Among her accolades are 12 Grammy Awards, including three Album of the Year wins; an Emmy Award; 40 American Music Awards; 29 Billboard Music Awards; three IFPI Global Recording Artist of the Year awards; and 92 Guinness World Records. Swift has been featured in rankings such as Rolling Stone's 100 Greatest Songwriters of All Time, Billboard's Greatest of All Time Artists, the Time 100 and Forbes Celebrity 100. Honored with titles such as Artist of the Decade and Woman of the Decade, Swift is an advocate for artists' rights and women's empowerment.

The only metadata retained on a per-consumer basis is the offset or position of that consumer in a topic. This offset is controlled by the consumer.\n- Partitions: Kafka uses partitions to split a topic's messages across multiple brokers for scalability and performance. Events with the same event key, such as the same customer identifier or vehicle ID, are written to the same partition, and Kafka guarantees that any consumer of a given topic partition will always read that partition\u2019s events in exactly the same order as they were written.\n- Replication: Multiple brokers always have a copy of the data to guarantee high availability and fault tolerance.

For example, a company might want to handles its Google Ads and Analytics data in Google Cloud and deploy kubernetes through GKE. And the company\u00a0might want to adopt Azure specifically\u00a0for Microsoft workloads. And the company\u00a0may like AWS for some best-in-class services and its huge mindshare, making it easy\u00a0to find AWS-proficient\u00a0engineers. Given the intense competition among\u00a0cloud providers, expect\u00a0them to offer more best-of-breed services, making multicloud more compelling."}]}

Recommend a ski resort in Tahoe including trails that I can use to follow the plan.\n"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Skiing is a fun sport with something for every age and skill level. The measure of \"hard\" in skiing may be subjective but as a general rule of thumb, trails become harder as the steepness or pitch increases, number and type of obstacles increase, the trail is bumpier or is narrower. Changes along these dimensions present new challenges and require a broader array of skills. \n\nA good way to progress along trails is to pick a trail that presents a challenge in one or two dimensions of \"hard\" to learn or refine skills. As you progress, you can increase the challenges along different dimensions. Labelling at ski resorts help with these choices. Trails are generally classified into bunny (easiest or learning greens), green (circle), blue (square), black (diamond) and double black (two diamonds). When you are learning skiing, it's best to get reasonably confident at a color before moving on to the next one. You don't have to be perfect but you have to feel safe as you progress. While colors are broadly useful, they can still be inexact as measures of hardness. Further, your strengths and weaknesses will also play a part in determining how hard a trail is for you personally. Staff at ski resorts can point you to good trails based on your personal comfort. Remember to always ski with a friend !\n\nFor following this plan, you should consider Kirkwood Ski Resort near South Lake Tahoe. Kirkwood has a reputation for some great advanced skiing trails but it presents many good trails for progressive improvement. If this is your first time skiing, a lesson is strongly recommended to learn the basics of keeping yourselves and those around you safe ! \n\nYou can start on the Timber Creek Area where there are a few bunny trails that are perfect for beginners. Funny bunny and School Run offer plenty of gentle practice for a new skier and when you are ready, ski Graduation (cue confetti). Squirrel Ridge and Snowkirk (on the Mountain Village side) are good next steps because they are long gentle greens.\n\nOnce you are feeling confident, Free 'N' Easy and Hole 'N' Wall offer a gentle introduction to blues. Blues at Kirkwood cater to a wide range of skills. The areas around Lower Zachary and Flying Carpet are good next challenges. If you are feeling good on those blues, try the backside with the appropriately named \"Happiness Is\"\n\nIf you've really got it down, it's time to try some black diamonds. Groomed blacks are easier to ski and fresh snow lowers the challenge further. Try Zachary and the trails around it. At this level, each black may offer a different kind of challenge. Hully Gully may have bumps and Lower Olympic is a nice introduction to a bowl.  There are many to choose from !\n\nThe final challenges are the double blacks and the The Wall is well known favorite. There are no dearth of double blacks and off piste trails at Kirkwood for those that have progressed beyond the labelling.\n\nHave fun and stay safe !"}]}

The illusion of a moving Sun results from Earth observers being in a rotating reference frame; this apparent motion caused many cultures to have mythologies and religions built around the geocentric model, which prevailed until astronomer Nicolaus Copernicus formulated his heliocentric model in the 16th century.\nAstronomically, sunrise occurs for only an instant: the moment at which the upper limb of the Sun appears tangent to the horizon. However, the term sunrise commonly refers to periods of time both before and after this point:\nTwilight, the period in the morning during which the sky is brightening, but the Sun is not yet visible. The beginning of morning twilight is called astronomical dawn.\nThe period after the Sun rises during which striking colors and atmospheric effects are still seen.\nThe timing of sunrise varies throughout the year and is also affected by the viewer's latitude and longitude, altitude, and time zone. These changes are driven by the axial tilt of Earth, daily rotation of the Earth, the planet's movement in its annual elliptical orbit around the Sun, and the Earth and Moon's paired revolutions around each other. The analemma can be used to make approximate predictions of the time of sunrise.\nIn late winter and spring, sunrise as seen from temperate latitudes occurs earlier each day, reaching its earliest time near the summer solstice; although the exact date varies by latitude. After this point, the time of sunrise gets later each day, reaching its latest sometime around the winter solstice. The offset between the dates of the solstice and the earliest or latest sunrise time is caused by the eccentricity of Earth's orbit and the tilt of its axis, and is described by the analemma, which can be used to predict the dates.\nVariations in atmospheric refraction can alter the time of sunrise by changing its apparent position. Near the poles, the time-of-day variation is exaggerated, since the Sun crosses the horizon at a very shallow angle and thus rises more slowly.\nAccounting for atmospheric refraction and measuring from the leading edge slightly increases the average duration of day relative to night. The sunrise equation, however, which is used to derive the time of sunrise and sunset, uses the Sun's physical center for calculation, neglecting atmospheric refraction and the non-zero angle subtended by the solar disc.\nOutput:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Although the Sun appears to \"rise\" from the horizon, it is actually the Earth's motion that causes the Sun to appear.

{"dataset": "alpagasus_3k_dolly", "id": "alpagasus_3k_1125", "messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What is this text about?\nThere are many modern variations of gazpacho with avocados, cucumbers, parsley, strawberries, watermelon, grapes, meat stock, seafood, and other ingredients instead of tomatoes and bread. The ingredients, texture, and thickness of gazpacho vary regionally and between different cooks. Similar cold raw soups such as arjamolho in Portugal, porra antequerana and ajoblanco, are also popular in Andalusia, although not as widespread as gazpacho. Gazpacho and salmorejo are especially similar since they are both tomato-based cold soups that are widely popular in Spain; the main difference between gazpacho and salmorejo is the culinary technique used since gazpacho is a soup whereas salmorejo is an emulsion. In addition, while both dishes share the main ingredients of tomato, olive oil, bread, and garlic, gazpacho can also be prepared with cucumber, peppers, and vinegar, whereas salmorejo cannot. The original recipe using bread, water, vinegar, oil, and salt is traditional in the Iberian Peninsula, perhaps going back to Roman times. Every central and southern region has its own variety. The humble gazpacho became a very deeply rooted food for peasants and shepherds in Spain. The basic gazpacho gave rise to many variants, some also called gazpacho, others not; some authors have tried to classify all these variations. Gazpachos may be classified by colour: the most usual red ones (which contain tomato), white ones (which contain no tomato, but include dried fruits), and green ones (which are white but contain some spices that make them green). These variants have their basic ingredients in common, including garlic paste which works as an emulsifier, bread, olive oil, vinegar and salt. In addition to the traditional ingredients, red fruits such as strawberries, muskmelon, etc., may be added, making the gazpacho a bit sweeter. Gazpacho may be served as a starter, main dish, or tapa.\n\nA popular variation comes from the town of Rota in the province of C\u00e1diz. During times of drought, there was not enough water to make gazpacho; thus, arranque has the same ingredients as gazpacho, but requires less water and bread, making it a sort of cream. Some people add more bread until it takes on the consistency of a dip.\n\nIn Extremadura, gazpachos are a kind of pur\u00e9e or thick gazpacho known as cojondongo, or cojondongo del ga\u00f1\u00e1n, made of breadcrumbs, garlic, oil, and vinegar, then topped with chopped onions, tomato and peppers.\n\nGazpacho manchego, as its name implies, is made in the east region of La Mancha, in Albacete and nearby areas, and is popular in other areas in the center and southwest of the country. It is a meat stew, whose main ingredients are small game animals or birds such as rabbit, hare, quail, or pigeon, and flatbread, and may include garlic, tomatoes, and mushrooms. It is cooked in a cauldron and served hot. Another well-known variant in La Mancha is gazpacho de pastor or galiano. Some other hot meat or fish dishes from other regions are called gazpacho (gazpacho jumillano, gazpacho de Yecla, gazpacho de Requena, etc.)\n\nGazpacho is often eaten during the very hot and dry summers in Castilla y Le\u00f3n. The gazpacho made in La Mora\u00f1a in the province of \u00c1vila has large pieces of vegetables floating in a watery soup.\n\nGazpacho manchego, despite its name, is a meat stew, served hot, not a variation on the cold vegetable soup.\n\n"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "This text is about variations of Gazpachos.

If you find any of these be sure to quarantine your new plant away from your current plants and treat with a pesticide of your choosing. Many houseplant owners use neem oil to treat pests. Third, upsize or repot your plant only when it is ready. Your new plant likely will be happy for a while in its current nursery (plastic) container that it came home from the shop in. You can choose to upsize the pot once you notice signs of the plant being root bound (the roots take up a majority of the pot) such as water draining from the pot quickly and the soil not becoming saturated or the plant slows its growth of new leaves (unless its the winter season at which time plants naturally slow or stop new growth).

Typically, the short fragments (reads) result from shotgun sequencing genomic DNA, or gene transcript (ESTs).\n\nThe problem of sequence assembly can be compared to taking many copies of a book, passing each of them through a shredder with a different cutter, and piecing the text of the book back together just by looking at the shredded pieces. Besides the obvious difficulty of this task, there are some extra practical issues: the original may have many repeated paragraphs, and some shreds may be modified during shredding to have typos.

Most medical professionals agree that the causes of migraines are unknown, however there are a number of triggers that can set off a migraine in sufferers. These include dietary triggers such as dehydration, coffee, alcohol and many others. Hormonal changes can also be a trigger, so many women are impacted during their menstrual cycle. Other triggers such as stress and emotional anguish can also cause the onset of migraines. Environmental factors such as bright or flickering lights can also be a trigger.\n\nFor most sufferers, rest and non-prescription painkillers such as ibuprofen are sufficient to recover from a headache, but more extreme cases may require a visit to a GP and prescription of triptans to alleviate the symptoms.

In 1794, President George Washington appointed Adams as the U.S. ambassador to the Netherlands, and Adams would serve in high-ranking diplomatic posts until 1801, when Thomas Jefferson took office as president. Federalist leaders in Massachusetts arranged for Adams's election to the United States Senate in 1802, but Adams broke with the Federalist Party over foreign policy and was denied re-election. In 1809, President James Madison, a member of the Democratic-Republican Party, appointed Adams as the U.S. ambassador to Russia. Multilingual, Adams held diplomatic posts for the duration of Madison's presidency, and he served as part of the American delegation that negotiated an end to the War of 1812. In 1817, President James Monroe selected Adams as his Secretary of State. In that role, Adams negotiated the Adams\u2013On\u00eds Treaty, which provided for the American acquisition of Florida. He also helped formulate the Monroe Doctrine, which became a key tenet of U.S. foreign policy. In 1818, Adams was elected a member of the American Philosophical Society in Philadelphia.\n\nAdams, Andrew Jackson, William H. Crawford, and Henry Clay\u2014all members of the Democratic-Republican Party\u2014competed in the 1824 presidential election. Because no candidate won a majority of electoral votes, the House of Representatives held a contingent election, which Adams won with the support of Speaker of the House Clay, whom Adams would go on to controversially appoint as his Secretary of State. As president, Adams called for an ambitious agenda that included federally funded infrastructure projects, the establishment of a national university, and engagement with the countries of Latin America, but Congress refused to pass many of his initiatives. During Adams's presidency, the Democratic-Republican Party split into two major camps: the National Republican Party, which supported President Adams, and Andrew Jackson's Democratic Party. The Democrats proved to be more effective political organizers than Adams and his National Republican supporters, and Jackson soundly defeated Adams in the 1828 presidential election, making Adams the second president to fail to win re-election (his father being the first).\n\nRather than retiring from public service, Adams won election to the House of Representatives, where he would serve from 1831 until his death in 1848. He remains the only former president to be elected to the chamber. After narrowly losing his bids for Governor of Massachusetts and Senate re-election, Adams joined the Anti-Masonic Party in the early 1830s before joining the Whig Party, which united those opposed to President Jackson. During his time in Congress, Adams became increasingly critical of slavery and of the Southern leaders whom he believed controlled the Democratic Party. He was particularly opposed to the annexation of Texas and the Mexican\u2013American War, which he saw as a war to extend slavery and its political grip on Congress. He also led the repeal of the \"gag rule\", which had prevented the House of Representatives from debating petitions to abolish slavery. Historians concur that Adams was one of the greatest diplomats and secretaries of state in American history; they typically rank him as an average president, as he had an ambitious agenda but could not get it passed by Congress. By contrast, historians also view Adams in a more positive light during his post-presidency because of his vehement stance against slavery, as well as his fight for the rights of women and Native Americans."}]}

Jordan is the principal owner and chairman of the Charlotte Hornets of the NBA and of 23XI Racing in the NASCAR Cup Series. He was integral in popularizing the basketball sport and the NBA around the world in the 1980s and 1990s, becoming a global cultural icon.\n\nJordan played college basketball for three seasons under coach Dean Smith with the North Carolina Tar Heels. As a freshman, he was a member of the Tar Heels' national championship team in 1982. Jordan joined the Bulls in 1984 as the third overall draft pick, and quickly emerged as a league star, entertaining crowds with his prolific scoring while gaining a reputation as one of the game's best defensive players. His leaping ability, demonstrated by performing slam dunks from the free-throw line in Slam Dunk Contests, earned him the nicknames \"Air Jordan\" and \"His Airness\". Jordan won his first NBA title with the Bulls in 1991, and followed that achievement with titles in 1992 and 1993, securing a three-peat. Jordan abruptly retired from basketball before the 1993\u201394 NBA season to play Minor League Baseball but returned to the Bulls in March 1995 and led them to three more championships in 1996, 1997, and 1998, as well as a then-record 72 regular season wins in the 1995\u201396 NBA season. He retired for the second time in January 1999 but returned for two more NBA seasons from 2001 to 2003 as a member of the Washington Wizards.

Hardwoods, on the other hand, are called \"hard\" because of much denser grains: compared to softwoods, hardwoods weigh more per volume due to this property. In other words, a board of walnut (a hardwood) weighs more than a board of the same size of pine (a softwood).

Singlish arose out of a situation of prolonged language contact between speakers of many different languages in Singapore, including Hokkien, Malay, Teochew, Cantonese and Tamil.\n\nSinglish originated with the arrival of the British and the establishment of English-medium education in Singapore. Elements of English quickly filtered out of schools and onto the streets, resulting in the development of a pidgin language spoken by non-native speakers as a lingua franca used for communication between speakers of the many different languages used in Singapore. Singlish evolved mainly among the working classes who learned elements of English without formal schooling, mixing in elements of their native languages. After some time, this new pidgin language, now combined with substantial influences from Indian English, Peranakan, southern varieties of Chinese, Malay, and Tamil, became the primary language of the streets. As Singlish grew in popularity, children began to acquire Singlish as their native language, a process known as creolization. Through this process of creolization, Singlish became a fully-formed, stabilized and independent creole language, acquiring a more robust vocabulary and more complex grammar, with fixed phonology, syntax, morphology, and syntactic embedding.\n\nSinglish shares many linguistic similarities with Manglish or Bazaar Malay of Malaysia, although a few distinctions can be made, particularly in vocabulary. Manglish generally receives more Malay influence and Singlish more Chinese (Mandarin, Hokkien, etc.) influence. Initially, Singlish and Manglish were essentially the same dialect evolving from the British Malaya economy, born in the trading ports of Singapore, Malacca and Penang when Singapore and Peninsular Malaysia were for many purposes a de facto (from 1963 to 1965, de jure) single entity. Ever since the two countries separated, a divergence has been observed.\n\nLike all languages, Singlish and other creole languages show consistent internal logic and grammatical complexity. Due to its origins, Singlish shares many similarities with other English-based creole languages. As with many other creole languages, it is sometimes incorrectly perceived to be a \"broken\" form of the lexifier language - in this case, English. The uniqueness of Singlish has been studied by linguistics experts beyond Singapore."}]}

It is best to consult an experienced boot fitter to ensure the boot is set up correctly. Once you've ensured the boot is set up correctly, it is likely a technique issue. A common cause of A-frame is a result of rotating the outside knee inside more than the inside knee, and this can happen due to wider skis or wanting to create a bigger edge angle. Ideally, we should avoid over-rotating the knee inside as this creates a weaker position and instead rely on moving the hip and upper body into the inside of the turn to create a bigger edge angle and try to keep the outside leg relatively straight.\n\nA good exercise to practice this is the T-drill, where you try to make sure your outside leg is as straight as possible and create edge angle by leaning your whole body into the turn, you'll need to shorten your inside leg by bringing your need to your chest, which will then still allow you to balance mostly on your straight downhill leg."}]}

He is currently ranked world No. 14 in singles by the Association of Tennis Professionals (ATP). He has been ranked world No. 1 for 209 weeks, and has finished as the year-end No. 1 five times. He also holds the record for most consecutive weeks in the Top 10 of the ATP Rankings, having never left the Top 10 from April 2005 to March 2023, a total of 912 weeks. Nadal has won a joint-record 22 Grand Slam men's singles titles, including a record 14 French Open titles. He has won 92 ATP singles titles, including 36 Masters titles, with 63 of these on clay courts. Nadal is one of only two men to complete the Career Golden Slam in singles. His 81 consecutive wins on clay is the longest single-surface win streak in the Open Era.\n\nFor over a decade, Nadal has dominated men's tennis along with Roger Federer and Novak Djokovic as the Big Three, collectively considered by many to be the three greatest male tennis players of all time. At the start of his professional career, Nadal became one of the most successful teenagers in ATP Tour history, reaching the world No. 2 ranking and winning 16 titles before turning 20, including his first French Open and six Masters events. Nadal became the world No. 1 for the first time in 2008 after defeating Federer in a historic Wimbledon final, his first major victory off clay. He followed up his win with an Olympic singles gold at the 2008 Beijing Olympics. After defeating Djokovic in the 2010 US Open final, then-24-year-old Nadal became the youngest man in the Open Era to achieve the Career Grand Slam, and the first man to win majors on three different surfaces (hard, grass, and clay) in the same year (Surface Slam).\n\nAfter two injury-plagued seasons, Nadal made a stellar return in one of the greatest comeback seasons of all time in 2013; reaching 14 finals, winning two majors and five Masters events including the US Open Series sweep (Summer Slam). He continued his dominance at the French Open, securing six titles, two US Open titles, an Australian Open title, and an Olympic doubles gold at the 2016 Rio Olympics with Marc L\u00f3pez. Nadal surpassed his joint-record with Djokovic and Federer for the most major men's singles titles at the 2022 Australian Open, and became one of four men in history to complete the double Career Grand Slam in singles. He appeared in the Top 10 of the ATP rankings continuously from April 2005 to March 2023 \u2013 a record spanning 18 years.\n\nAs a vigorous left-handed player, one of Nadal's main strengths is his forehand, which he hits with extremely heavy topspin at difficult angles. He is one of the best at breaking serve, regularly appearing among the tour leaders in percentage of return games, return points, and break points won. Nadal has won the Stefan Edberg Sportsmanship Award five times, and was the Laureus World Sportsman of the Year in 2011 and 2021. He is also a recipient of the Grand Cross of the Order of Dos De Mayo, the Grand Cross of Naval Merit, and the Medal of the City of Paris.

This makes it a lot more scary and sad when eventually most of them become prey to the alien.\n\nSecondly, the main villain in Alien is not only way scarier than almost any other creature villain ever made, the way they build up both her backstory and her eventual full reveal is amazing. When we first see the small chestburster alien, neither we nor the crew have any idea how big, terrifying, and lethal she will become. From her sticky, slick sheen to her cunning and silent hunting skills, she is truly an unstoppable force. If I were trapped on a spaceship with that creature, I don't know what I'd do.\n\nAnd finally, Alien just feels more \"real\" with its universal and timely themes of greed and fear of the unknown. There are numerous actual stories of mining companies betraying their field employees and endangering their lives for a quick buck; isolated teams of workers going crazy,  suffering from unseen maladies, and falling into chaos and disarray; and of course, the tale of predator and prey is perhaps the oldest one of all.

{"dataset": "alpagasus_3k_dolly", "id": "alpagasus_3k_1354", "messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Given these paragraphs about Multiomics, what is a typical advantage of single-cell multiomics versus bulk analysis?\n\nInput: Multiomics, multi-omics, integrative omics, \"panomics\" or \"pan-omics\" is a biological analysis approach in which the data sets are multiple \"omes\", such as the genome, proteome, transcriptome, epigenome, metabolome, and microbiome (i.e., a meta-genome and/or meta-transcriptome, depending upon how it is sequenced); in other words, the use of multiple omics technologies to study life in a concerted way. By combining these \"omes\", scientists can analyze complex biological big data to find novel associations between biological entities, pinpoint relevant biomarkers and build elaborate markers of disease and physiology. In doing so, multiomics integrates diverse omics data to find a coherently matching geno-pheno-envirotype relationship or association. The OmicTools service lists more than 99 softwares related to multiomic data analysis, as well as more than 99 databases on the topic.\n\nSystems biology approaches are often based upon the use of panomic analysis data. The American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO) defines panomics as referring to \"the interaction of all biological functions within a cell and with other body functions, combining data collected by targeted tests ... and global assays (such as genome sequencing) with other patient-specific information.\"\n\nSingle-cell multiomics\nA branch of the field of multiomics is the analysis of multilevel single-cell data, called single-cell multiomics. This approach gives us an unprecedent resolution to look at multilevel transitions in health and disease at the single cell level. An advantage in relation to bulk analysis is to mitigate confounding factors derived from cell to cell variation, allowing the uncovering of heterogeneous tissue architectures.\n\nMethods for parallel single-cell genomic and transcriptomic analysis can be based on simultaneous amplification or physical separation of RNA and genomic DNA. They allow insights that cannot be gathered solely from transcriptomic analysis, as RNA data do not contain non-coding genomic regions and information regarding copy-number variation, for example. An extension of this methodology is the integration of single-cell transcriptomes to single-cell methylomes, combining single-cell bisulfite sequencing to single cell RNA-Seq. Other techniques to query the epigenome, as single-cell ATAC-Seq and single-cell Hi-C also exist.\n\nA different, but related, challenge is the integration of proteomic and transcriptomic data. One approach to perform such measurement is to physically separate single-cell lysates in two, processing half for RNA, and half for proteins. The protein content of lysates can be measured by proximity extension assays (PEA), for example, which use DNA-barcoded antibodies. A different approach uses a combination of heavy-metal RNA probes and protein antibodies to adapt mass cytometry for multiomic analysis.\n\nMultiomics and machine learning\nIn parallel to the advances in highthroughput biology, machine learning applications to biomedical data analysis are flourishing. The integration of multi-omics data analysis and machine learning has led to the discovery of new biomarkers. For example, one of the methods of the mixOmics project implements a method based on sparse Partial Least Squares regression for selection of features (putative biomarkers).\n\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multiomics\n\nOutput:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "An advantage of single-cell multiomics in relation to bulk analysis is to mitigate confounding factors derived from cell to cell variation, allowing the uncovering of heterogeneous tissue architectures."}]}

The schedule teaches them that there are times to eat, times to play and times to do their business. Typically, a puppy can control their bladder one hour for every month of age. So if your puppy is 2 months old, they can hold it for about two hours. Don't go longer than this between bathroom breaks or they\u2019re likely to have an accident.\n\nTake your puppy outside frequently\u2014at least every two hours\u2014and immediately after they wake up, during and after playing, and after eating or drinking.\n\nPick a bathroom spot outside, and always take your puppy (on a leash) to that spot. While your puppy is relieving themselves, use a specific word or phrase that you can eventually use before they go to remind them what to do. Take them out for a longer walk or some playtime only after they have eliminated.\n\nReward your puppy every time they eliminate outdoors. Praise or give treats\u2014but remember to do so immediately after they\u2019ve finished, not after they come back inside. This step is vital, because rewarding your dog for going outdoors is the only way to teach what's expected of them. Before rewarding, be sure they\u2019re finished. Puppies are easily distracted and if you praise too soon, they may forget to finish until they\u2019re back in the house.\n\nPut your puppy on a regular feeding schedule. What goes into a puppy on a schedule comes out of a puppy on a schedule. Depending on their age, puppies may need to be fed two or three times a day. Feeding your puppy at the same times each day will make it more likely that they'll eliminate at consistent times as well, making house training easier for both of you.\n\nPick up your puppy's water dish about two and a half hours before bedtime to reduce the likelihood that they'll need to relieve themselves during the night. Most puppies can sleep for approximately seven hours without needing a bathroom break. If your puppy does wake you up in the night, don't make a big deal of it; otherwise, they will think it is time to play and won't want to go back to sleep. Turn on as few lights as possible, don't talk to or play with your puppy, take them out to the spot where they relieve themselves and then return them to bed."}]}

It focuses on technical apparel for mountaineering and Alpine sports, including related accessories. The company's name and logo reference the Archaeopteryx, the transitional fossil of early dinosaurs to modern dinosaurs (birds). Arc'teryx is known for their waterproof Gore-Tex shell jackets, knitwear, and down parkas.\n\nFounded in 1989 as Rock Solid, the company re-branded in 1991 as Arc'teryx to produce outerwear and climbing gear for the Coast Mountains in Canada. The company was sold to Salomon Group in 2001 and Amer Sports in 2005. Arc'teryx maintains two divisions: Veilance, their luxury streetwear retailer and LEAF, their retailer of technical gear for law enforcement and military forces.\n\nThe company is a major influence in the \"gorpcore\" and \"normcore\" fashion movements, the wearing of minimalist, outdoor apparel in urban settings.\n\nHistory\n\nAn Arc'teryx boutique on Mercer Street, London in July 2016\nOriginally named \"Rock Solid\" by founder Dave Lane, the company's first line of products was climbing gear. Dave Lane sold his 50% interest to Blair Murdoch and Tim Duholke who became silent partners in 1989. Then-principal Jeremy Guard changed the company name to Arc'teryx in 1991 to reflect the company's vision of creating disruptive \"evolutionary\" innovation within the outdoor products industry. Guard was president and principal of the company from 1991 to 2001. Using a heat laminate (thermolamination) technology, the partners designed and marketed the Vapor harness, which would become the company's most popular item. In 1993, after a series of relocations and staff additions, Arc'teryx released the Bora backpack using the same Vapor technology. In 1996, the company introduced technical apparel featuring Gore-Tex after obtaining a license from W. L. Gore & Associates. Arc'teryx re-located its headquarters to Burnaby, British Columbia in 1999 and then to North Vancouver in 2005.\n\nIn 2001, Arc'teryx was purchased by Salomon Group, a French subsidiary of the German retailer Adidas. In 2005, Arc'teryx was sold to Finnish retailer Amer Sports. In 2019, Chinese retailer Anta Sports bought a controlling stake (56%) in Amer. The Arc'teryx head office is located in North Vancouver and harnesses, backpacks, and other apparel is made in its own factory in New Westminster, BC. As their apparel line expanded Arc'teryx began manufacturing in international markets, specifically in China, the Philippines, Vietnam, Bangladesh, El Salvador, Laos, and Greece.\n\nJon Hoerauf joined the company as president in 2012, assuming the additional role of general manager in 2016. During the early 2020s, Arc'teryx co-produced items with high-fashion brands and designers which expanded their consumer market beyond outdoor enthusiasts.\n\nDivisions\nVeilance\nArc'teryx launched their luxury formal urban-wear brand in 2009, branded as Arc'teryx Veilance.\n\nLEAF\nArc'teryx's Law Enforcement and Armed Forces (LEAF) line is aimed at the military and police market. In the consumer and Internet market, it is often referred to as \"military birds\". Some of the collections are designed for their civilian counterparts, while others, such as Arc'teryx's Tango and Charlie backpacks, feature camouflage designs that are entirely geared toward the military. In contrast, military bird products use dark colors and military colors. Only a handful of products, such as the Alpha jacket, are currently made in Canada, while the rest, such as Assault Shirt, are made overseas, such as in El Salvador and Vietnam.\n\nSubculture\nArc'teryx has become widely popular in the street fashion scene and Internet culture. The theft (\"racking\") of Arc'teryx and other Gore-Tex items is considered to be part of the street subculture. It is seen as a high-end status symbol among youth, \"just shy of Stone Island and Moncler.\" The Atlantic noted the brand as selling \"premium-tier outdoorsiness\" while the Financial Times noted one of their largest demographics as \"urbanites\" in 2022.\n\nLabeled a cult brand by Fast Company in 2021, Arc'teryx is worn by \" hikers and hype-beasts\" according to The New York Times.\n\nThe company is a major influence in the \"gorpcore\" and \"normcore\" fashion movements \u2013 the wearing of minimalist, outdoor apparel in urban settings, along with Mammut, REI, Marmot and Patagonia.\n\nThroughout 2022, a TikTok trend emerged where individuals would shower, fully clothed with an Arc'teryx jacket, as British rapper YT's song \"Arc'teryx\" played on background.\n\nOutput:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "- Arc'teryx is a Canadian company which produces high-tech outdoor gears\n- Their best known products include waterproof Gore-Tex shell jackets, knitwear, and down parkas\n- Started as a company selling climbing gears, the company went through several re-branding and, in early 2020s, co-produced items with high-fashion brands which expanded their consumer market beyond outdoor enthusiasts\n- The company owns two branches, one for commercial consumers, the other for military and police market\n-  The company, especially its Gore-Tex product line, has become a popular urban street fashion  and has a major influence in the \"gorpcore\" and \"normcore\" fashion movements,  along with similar brands such as Mammut, REI, Marmot and Patagonia"}]}

The book is recognized as a classic in children's literature, and is one of the best-selling books of all time with over 100 million copies sold.\n\nThe Hobbit is set in Middle-earth and follows home-loving Bilbo Baggins, the titular hobbit, who joins the wizard Gandalf and thirteen dwarves that make up Thorin Oakenshield's Company, on a quest to reclaim the dwarves' home and treasure from the dragon Smaug. Bilbo's journey takes him from his peaceful rural surroundings into more sinister territory.\n\nThe story is told in the form of an episodic quest, and most chapters introduce a specific creature or type of creature of Tolkien's geography. Bilbo gains a new level of maturity, competence, and wisdom by accepting the disreputable, romantic, fey, and adventurous sides of his nature and applying his wits and common sense. The story reaches its climax in the Battle of Five Armies, where many of the characters and creatures from earlier chapters re-emerge to engage in conflict.\n\nPersonal growth and forms of heroism are central themes of the story, along with motifs of warfare. These themes have led critics to view Tolkien's own experiences during World War I as instrumental in shaping the story. The author's scholarly knowledge of Germanic philology and interest in mythology and fairy tales are often noted as influences.\n\nThe publisher was encouraged by the book's critical and financial success and, therefore, requested a sequel. As Tolkien's work progressed on its successor, The Lord of the Rings, he made retrospective accommodations for it in The Hobbit. These few but significant changes were integrated into the second edition. Further editions followed with minor emendations, including those reflecting Tolkien's changing concept of the world into which Bilbo stumbled.\n\nThe work has never been out of print. Its ongoing legacy encompasses many adaptations for stage, screen, radio, board games, and video games. Several of these adaptations have received critical recognition on their own merits."}]}

Keyboardist Boom Gaspar has also been a touring/session member with the band since 2002. Drummers Jack Irons, Dave Krusen, Matt Chamberlain, and Dave Abbruzzese are former members of the band. Pearl Jam outsold many of their contemporaries from the early 1990s, and are considered one of the most influential bands of the decade, being dubbed as \"the most popular American rock and roll band of the '90s\".\n\nFormed after the demise of Gossard and Ament's previous band, Mother Love Bone, Pearl Jam broke into the mainstream with their debut album, Ten, in 1991. Ten stayed on the Billboard 200 chart for nearly five years, and has gone on to become one of the highest-selling rock records ever, going 13\u00d7 platinum in the United States. Released in 1993, Pearl Jam's second album, Vs., sold over 950,000 copies in its first week of release, setting the record for most copies of an album sold in its first week of release at the time. Their third album, Vitalogy (1994), became the second-fastest-selling CD in history at the time, with more than 877,000 units sold in its first week.\n\nOne of the key bands in the grunge movement of the early 1990s, Pearl Jam's members often shunned popular music industry practices such as making music videos or participating in interviews. The band also sued Ticketmaster, claiming it had monopolized the concert-ticket market. In 2006, Rolling Stone described the band as having \"spent much of the past decade deliberately tearing apart their own fame.\"\n\nPearl Jam had sold more than 85 million albums worldwide by 2018, including nearly 32 million albums in the United States by 2012, making them one of the best-selling bands of all time. Pearl Jam was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 2017 in its first year of eligibility. They were ranked eighth in a readers' poll by Rolling Stone magazine in its \"Top Ten Live Acts of All Time\" issue. Throughout its career, the band has also promoted wider social and political issues, from pro-abortion rights sentiments to opposition to George W. Bush's presidency. Vedder acts as the band's spokesman on these issues."}]}

Her blood chemistry values measure total cholesterol at 195 mg% and HDL cholesterol at 42 mg%. Her fasting blood sugar is 105 mg%. Roslyn is sedentary and has engaged in no endurance training program since college. Brainstorm an appropriate exercise training program to help Roslyn improve her C-R (cardiorespiratory) fitness. Be sure to calculate a target heart rate range with corresponding RPE.\n\nAnswer:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "We can prescribe an exercise program through the lens of FITT: frequency, intensity, time, and type. For frequency, we should aim for 3-5 days per week, with the higher the better the improvements for C-R fitness. As for intensity, we want to aim for 60-90% HRR (heart rate recovery), anywhere from 4-8 RPE (rate of perceived exertion). Since Roslyn is 36 years of age, her predicted maximum heart rate is 184bpm, and we are given that her RHR (resting heart rate) is 64bpm. Thus, we\u2019re aiming for a target heart rate range of 136 BPM to 172 BPM. For time, the duration depends on intensity, but optimally, we want to be working out for at least 20 minutes and at most an hour. As for the type of exercise, we can assess the options that are available and feasible for Roslyn to perform, and choose between weight-bearing exercises (such as walking or jogging) and non-weight-bearing exercises such as swimming or rowing. Another thing to consider is that Roslyn is sedentary, and may need to slowly progress into a more intense workout. A sample exercise training program for Roslyn may first start with a moderate-intensity aerobic activity for 30 minutes a day, three times a week (Monday, Wednesday, and Friday). As she gets more acclimated to the exercise level, we want to progress to more vigorous exercise. According to David P. Swain, vigorous aerobic exercise may result in \u201csubstantially more benefits than moderate-intensity exercise\u201d, which include but are not limited to greater improvements in aerobic fitness and greater reductions in coronary heart disease risk. Thus, we can add two more days of vigorous aerobic exercise for Roslyn, such as jogging for 20 minutes on Tuesdays and Thursdays. Another important aspect to consider is motivation, which we can help Roslyn maintain by switching up her forms of exercise to keep interest. For example, we can switch out jogging with cycling, or hiking hilly terrain."}]}

Hank is brave and noble, maintaining a focus and determination even when presented with grave danger. Hank is a Ranger, with a magical energy bow that shoots arrows of glowing energy. These arrows can be used in many different ways such as a climbing tool, to hurt enemies, to bind them, to create light, or to form temporary makeshift cages.\nEric, the Cavalier (voiced by Don Most): The Cavalier, age 15, is the spoiled child, originating from a rich home. On the surface, Eric is a big-mouthed comic relief coward. Eric has a heroic core, and frequently saves his friends from danger with his magical Griffon Shield, which can project a force field. Despite his aloofness and several instances of selfishness, Eric shares the common camaraderie of the group, and occasionally steps to the fore as a substitute leader in Hank's absence.\nDiana, the Acrobat (voiced by Tonia Gayle Smith): Diana is a brave, athletic, and outspoken 14-year-old girl. She is an Acrobat who carries the Javelin Staff, which can change size to suit her needs and be easily reconstructed if broken. Diana is also known to provide inspiration, guidance and support for her friends at times of peril or worry.\nPresto, the Magician (voiced by Adam Rich): The 14-year-old Wizard of the team. Friendly and fiercely loyal to all in the group, Presto fulfills the role of the well-meaning, diligent magic user whose spells frequently\u2014though not always\u2014either fail or produce unintended results.\nSheila, the Thief (voiced by Katie Leigh): As the Thief, Sheila, aged 13, has the Cloak of Invisibility which makes her invisible when the hood is raised over her head. Although occasionally emotionally vulnerable and with a great fear of being alone in the realm, Sheila regularly utilizes the stealth attributes of her cloak at great peril to herself for the benefit of the common goals of her group.\nBobby, the Barbarian (voiced by Ted Field III): Bobby is the youngest member of the team at nine years old and the younger brother of Sheila. He is the Barbarian, as indicated by his fur pants and boots, horned helmet, and cross belt harness. Brash, brave and selfless but occasionally impulsive, Bobby's personality frequently puts himself and his friends in danger. His weapon saves the protagonists from peril on numerous occasions.\n\nResponse:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Hank (15) - Willie Aames\nEric (15) - Don Most\nDiana (14) - Tonia Gayle Smith\nPresto (14) - Adam Rich\nSheila (13) - Katie Leigh\nBobby (9) - Ted Field III"}]}

The reason for the order of events is that they proceed from more to less dangerous, so that the triathlete (as a triathlon participant is called) is most fresh and well-rested when they swim (so as to avoid drowning) and most exhausted during the run, when it is relatively less dangerous to make a mistake than it would be in the water or on a bicycle. Triathlons differ based on distance and terrain. They can be as short as a sprint event, which might include a swim as short as a single lap in a pool, or as long as an ironman triathlon, which includes a 2.4-mile swim, 112 miles of biking, and a full marathon. A common triathlon distance in between a spring and ironman is the olympic triathlon, which includes a 1.5-kilometer swim, 40 kilometer bike ride, and 10 kilometer run. Triathlons can take place anywhere where it is possible to do all three activities, including near a swimming pool, lake or open ocean. The run is most commonly done on a hard asphalt surface but can also take place on a dirt trail."}]}

{"dataset": "alpagasus_3k_dolly", "id": "alpagasus_3k_1411", "messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "When did mountain biking start?\n\nLate 1800s\nOne of the first examples of bicycles modified specifically for off-road use is the expedition of Buffalo Soldiers from Missoula, Montana, to Yellowstone in August 1896.[failed verification]\n\n1900s\u20131960s\nBicycles were ridden off-road by road racing cyclists who used cyclocross as a means of keeping fit during the winter. Cyclo-cross eventually became a sport in its own right in the 1940s, with the first world championship taking place in 1950.\n\nThe Rough Stuff Fellowship was established in 1955 by off-road cyclists in the United Kingdom.\n\nIn Oregon in 1966, one Chemeketan club member, D. Gwynn, built a rough terrain trail bicycle. He named it a \"mountain bicycle\" for its intended place of use. This may be the first use of that name.\n\nIn England in 1968, Geoff Apps, a motorbike trials rider, began experimenting with off-road bicycle designs. By 1979 he had developed a custom-built lightweight bicycle which was uniquely suited to the wet and muddy off-road conditions found in the south-east of England. They were designed around 2 inch x 650b Nokian snow tires though a 700x47c (28 in.) version was also produced. These were sold under the Cleland Cycles brand until late 1984. Bikes based on the Cleland design were also sold by English Cycles and Highpath Engineering until the early 1990s.\n\n1970s\u20131980s\nThere were several groups of riders in different areas of the U.S.A. who can make valid claims to playing a part in the birth of the sport. Riders in Crested Butte, Colorado, and Mill Valley, California, tinkered with bikes and adapted them to the rigors of off-road riding. Modified heavy cruiser bicycles, old 1930s and '40s Schwinn bicycles retrofitted with better brakes and fat tires, were used for freewheeling down mountain trails in Marin County, California, in the mid-to-late 1970s. At the time, there were no mountain bikes. The earliest ancestors of modern mountain bikes were based around frames from cruiser bicycles such as those made by Schwinn. The Schwinn Excelsior was the frame of choice due to its geometry. Riders used balloon-tired cruisers and modified them with gears and motocross or BMX-style handlebars, creating \"klunkers\". The term would also be used as a verb since the term \"mountain biking\" was not yet in use. The first person known to fit multiple speeds and drum brakes to a klunker is Russ Mahon of Cupertino, California, who used the resulting bike in cyclo-cross racing. Riders would race down mountain fire roads, causing the hub brake to burn the grease inside, requiring the riders to repack the bearings. These were called \"Repack Races\" and triggered the first innovations in mountain bike technology as well as the initial interest of the public (on Mt. Tamalpais in Marin CA, there is still a trail titled \"Repack\"\u2014in reference to these early competitions). The sport originated in California on Marin County's Mount Tamalpais.\n\nIt was not until the late 1970s and early 1980s that road bicycle companies started to manufacture mountain bicycles using high-tech lightweight materials. Joe Breeze is normally credited with introducing the first purpose-built mountain bike in 1978. Tom Ritchey then went on to make frames for a company called MountainBikes, a partnership between Gary Fisher, Charlie Kelly and Tom Ritchey. Tom Ritchey, a welder with skills in frame building, also built the original bikes. The company's three partners eventually dissolved their partnership, and the company became Fisher Mountain Bikes, while Tom Ritchey started his own frame shop.\n\nThe first mountain bikes were basically road bicycle frames (with heavier tubing and different geometry) with a wider frame and fork to allow for a wider tire. The handlebars were also different in that they were a straight, transverse-mounted handlebar, rather than the dropped, curved handlebars that are typically installed on road racing bicycles. Also, some of the parts on early production mountain bicycles were taken from the BMX bicycle. Other contributors were Otis Guy and Keith Bontrager.\n\nTom Ritchey built the first regularly available mountain bike frame, which was accessorized by Gary Fisher and Charlie Kelly and sold by their company called MountainBikes (later changed to Fisher Mountain Bikes, then bought by Trek, still under the name Gary Fisher, currently sold as Trek's \"Gary Fisher Collection\"). The first two mass-produced mountain bikes were sold in the early 1980s: the Specialized Stumpjumper and Univega Alpina Pro. In 1988, The Great Mountain Biking Video was released, soon followed by others. In 2007, Klunkerz: A Film About Mountain Bikes was released, documenting mountain bike history during the formative period in Northern California. Additionally, a group of mountain bikers called the Laguna Rads formed a club during the mid eighties and began a weekly ride, exploring the uncharted coastal hillsides of Laguna Beach, California. Industry insiders suggest that this was the birth of the freeride movement, as they were cycling up and down hills and mountains where no cycling specific trail network prexisted. The Laguna Rads have also held the longest running downhill race once a year since 1986.\n\nAt the time, the bicycle industry was not impressed with the mountain bike, regarding mountain biking to be short-term fad. In particular, large manufacturers such as Schwinn and Fuji failed to see the significance of an all-terrain bicycle and the coming boom in 'adventure sports'. Instead, the first mass-produced mountain bikes were pioneered by new companies such as MountainBikes (later, Fisher Mountain Bikes), Ritchey, and Specialized. Specialized was an American startup company that arranged for production of mountain bike frames from factories in Japan and Taiwan. First marketed in 1981, Specialized's mountain bike largely followed Tom Ritchey's frame geometry, but used TiG welding to join the frame tubes instead of fillet-brazing, a process better suited to mass production, and which helped to reduce labor and manufacturing cost. The bikes were configured with 15 gears using derailleurs, a triple chainring, and a cogset with five sprockets.\n\n"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Mountain biking as a sport came into existence in various areas in the USA in the late 1970s and early 1980s.  While many groups of riders in different US locations claim the birthright to mountain biking, it's clear that there wasn't a single person nor a single location that served as the starting point for the sport.  Riders in Crested Butte, CO, Marin County, CA, Mill Valley, CA, Cupertino, CA, and several other locations contributed significantly to the birth of the sport.\n\nIt wasn't until the late 1970s and early 1980s that bicycle companies began manufacturing mountain bikes with specific high-tech lightweight materials that popularized the sport.  Joe Breeze (Marin County) is often credited with building the first, purpose-built mountain bike in 1978.\n\nIt's important to note that there were mountain bike concepts and prototypes built well before this period, with the earliest concept belonging to the off-road bicycles used by the Buffalo Soldiers in 1896."}]}

The group is designated as a terrorist group by the United Nations Security Council, the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO), the European Union, and various other countries. Under bin Laden, Al-Qaeda was responsible for the September 11 attacks in the United States and many other mass-casualty attacks worldwide.\n\nAs a member of the wealthy Bin Laden family, Osama bin Laden was born in Saudi Arabia. His father was Mohammed bin Awad bin Laden, a Saudi millionaire from Hadhramaut, Yemen, and the founder of the construction company, Saudi Binladin Group. His mother, Alia Ghanem, was from a secular middle-class family in Latakia, Syria. He studied at university in the country until 1979, when he joined the Mujahideen forces in Pakistan fighting against the Soviet Union in Afghanistan. He helped to fund the Mujahideen by funneling arms, money, and fighters from the Arab world into Afghanistan, and gained popularity among many Arabs. In 1988, he formed al-Qaeda. He was banished from Saudi Arabia in 1992, lost his Saudi citizenship in 1994, and shifted his base to Sudan until US pressure forced him to leave in 1996. After establishing a new base in Afghanistan, he declared a war against the United States, launching a series of bombings and other violent related attacks. His involvement in the 1998 US embassy bombings landed him on the American Federal Bureau of Investigation's (FBI) lists of Ten Most Wanted Fugitives and Most Wanted Terrorists.\n\nBin Laden masterminded the September 11 attacks, which killed nearly 3,000 people and led President George W. Bush to invade Afghanistan and launch the \"War on Terror\". He became the subject of a decade-long international manhunt, during which the FBI offered a $25 million bounty on him. On 2 May 2011, he was killed by U.S. special operations forces at his compound in Abbottabad, Pakistan.\n\nA highly influential ideologue, bin Laden was able to first acquire sympathizers in the Islamic World due to his status a war-hero of the Afghan Jihad and subsequent focus on attacking Western imperialism. His targeting of civilians and hostile activities against Western governments have made him a reviled figure in the Western world and Western culture, and his role in the September 11 attacks has made public opinion of him in the United States unequivocally negative."}]}

But baseball is also a game obsessed with its own history, much like America is with hers and we can trace a lot of the story of baseball alongside the story of America. \n\nWhile the country was fighting itself to determine the shape of its future during the Civil War, the game of baseball was taking shape and spreading to the south by northern war prisoners. After the war, when mass market commercialism became available, baseball and its products were the primary sport marketed to people across the country. Many of the first American celebrities were in fact baseball players, their faces and names seen by millions of people through the rising circulation of newspapers and distribution of baseball cards.\n\nEven later, baseball was at the forefront of the Civil Rights Movement. Jackie Robinson became the first Black player to play Major League Baseball in the modern era. The integration of baseball was an early and important step in the broader Civil Rights Movement. Since then, baseball has been one of the most diverse sports in the world, its demographics closely representing that of the whole country.\n\nIn many ways, baseball culture has become synonymous with American culture in general. The season takes place through summer. There are hot dogs, nachos, a lot of sitting around, fireworks, and games on 4th of July.\n\nSo even as more countries and cultures find a way to make baseball their own, the sport can always claim its place as America's Pastime."}]}

Output:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Milly was 6 years old and ever since she could remember, fascinated by bees. Her mother called her their little apiologist. Her father called her \"honey bee.\" Her brother called her super tough because she had been stung by bees over 10 times and not once did she cry. The truth is, Milly felt like crying when she was stung, and it was not because the sting hurt. No, Milly was sad, because when a bee stings you, it dies and Milly loves bees.\n\nKnowing what you now know about Milly, it will be no surprise to you that the Jackson's came to her when they needed help. The Jackson's were Milly's neighbors, and Milly thought they were very cool. First off, they loved animals. Including 3 kids, 2 dogs, 2 cats, and 12 little silver fish that sparkled in this huge fishbowl. They dressed colorfully, they organized street-wide garage sales, and every few weeks, they invited Milly and her brother over to watch movies in their backyard that they projected off the side of their garage. \n\nThe Jackson's were not the type of people to worry about much, but on this day, they appeared very concerned. When Milly opened the door after she heard the doorbell ring, their they all were, Thomas and Lauren (the parents), Amber, Jade, Hugo (the kids), Bosko and Roscoe (the dogs), Felix and Helix (the cats), and sparkles (all of the fish were named sparkle because you couldn't tell them apart) in their fishbowl. Amber spoke up, \"Milly, we need your help, it's an emergency.\" Jade continued, \"There are bees everywhere!\" Hugo finished, \"At least Dad and Roscoe are allergic to bee stings, so we just grabbed everyone and ran!\"\n\nMilly's eyes darted between each of the people and pets in front of her. She could see and sense the fear in them. They did not know that there was nothing to fear, Milly the little apiologist was here. Milly took a deep breath, and calmly said, \"Lead me to them.\" Thomas said, \"Thank you Milly, we think they are coming out of the garage, but we're not sure\", as they started to walk next door. \n\nStepping through the grass, you could start to hear what the Jackson's were talking about. With each step, a droning buzz sound got closer. As Milly stepped off the lawn and onto the Jackson's driveway the buzzing went up a few decibels. She started to see them. Little movements in every direction - coming from the garage, going to the garage, bouncing off the windows of the car, hovering above the buffet of colorful flowers in the planters hanging on the side of the back deck. To some it might look chaotic, but to Milly, it was amazing. \n\nThe Jackson\u2019s stayed back, near the start of the driveway, holding their collective breaths, as Milly walked right into the swarms' midst. Milly\u2019s tie-dye shirt was bright pink and yellow, and had the words, \u201cFlower Power\u201d written on the front in bold, bubbly letters. It attracted a lot of attention. Bees were landing all over her, as if exploring the shirt for some hidden nectar. Unbothered, Milly stood there for a minute and just listened to the buzz. She could sense that it was louder towards the garage. Milly went to the green wooden door and peered in through the window. She could not believe her eyes.\n\nThe window on the door of the Jackson\u2019s garage was in need of a cleaning. But it was clear to Milly that something remarkable was behind this door, because she could see bees everywhere. Not just flying, but bees on the table top, the toolbox, the walls, the lights, the bicycles, they were everywhere. So many, the walls looked like they were moving. Milly opened the door and walked in, a few bees blasted out as the door opened, along with a rush of air carrying a slightly sweet fragrance. \n\nMore bees flew towards Milly, landing on her. Walking on her sleeves, hanging on to her shoe laces, getting tangled in her hair. Milly put her hand over her mouth and nose, so she could breathe without inhaling a bee. She had to keep blinking to keep the bees from obscuring her vision. She walked slowly to the table top that used to have a few tools on it, keeping a close eye on where she stepped. She started her search here, because she noticed a strange pattern in the surface movement: there was a small trail between thousands of bees on the wall behind the table top.\n\nMilly knows a lot about bees. That male bees don\u2019t have stingers. Females and males have different body types and shapes. Females have shorter antennae, males tend to be slimmer and smaller. Milly also knows that each hive has a single queen, and that the queen likes to walk quickly amongst her hive. As she walks, the workers all around her will part in front of her, leaving a small wake behind the queen. With this in mind, Millly scanned the wall, looking for her. \n\nAnd there she is. The queen bee stands out. She\u2019s larger in every way. The patterns on her wings are more clear. She moves where she pleases, and her workers are happy to clear a path in front of her. Milly reached out and picked her up. The buzzing in the garage got louder almost immediately. The bees near the wall, started to lift off and fly around quickly in front of Milly, who was once again holding a hand over her mouth and nose. Milly turned to face the door and began to retrace her steps back out of the garage. \n\nAs Milly took each step, more and more bees started to land on her closed hand holding the queen. Bees landed on her arm, on her shoulder, on neck, and slowly covered all of Milly\u2019s body. Milly made it to the door, and walked out. The Jackson\u2019s started yelling, \u201cMilly are you OK?!\u201d \u201cMilly??!!!!\u201d \u201cCall 9-1-1!!!\u201d Roscoe barked. Milly couldn\u2019t hear anything over the buzzing though. The weight of the bees was unexpectedly heavy. The bees were warm too, and she could feel a tinge of perspiration on her brow.\n\nMilly headed home. She didn\u2019t have any pets of her own, she didn\u2019t ask for much, but she was about to make a big ask. Milly still moved slowly, as her vision was still obscured given the movement in front, above, and below her eyes. She could sense the Jackson\u2019s kids rushing ahead of her, and shouting. Milly could feel the queen in her hand moving around, pushing at the edges between her fingers, trying to get through to her hive that was crawling all over Milly.\n\nAs she walked back across the lawn, she started to see people on the street watching her. She could see her house between blinks, and her mother and father walking towards her, with big grins on their faces. They walked right up to Milly, and spoke loudly to be heard over the buzzing. \u201cWhere are you going, my little beekeeper?\u201d Her dad\u2019s voice cut through the buzz. Milly just looked up at him, and over at her mom. She responded with her eyes, though blinking rapidly, those big green eyes conveyed a desire to her parents that they understood.\n\nThe two parents looked at each other and sighed, then looked back down at their daughter. \u201cSo, what are we supposed to do, get a nice box or jar for the queen?\u201d Milly nodded, and headed through the gate to their backyard. Milly\u2019s parents followed, along with her brother, and the Jackson\u2019s, though Roscoe stayed wearily at the back of the group. Milly\u2019s mother disappeared into their shed and emerged a few seconds later with a small box that had a lid with a very fine mesh. A temporary home for a queen.\n\nThe box was placed on the patio table and the group gathered around. Milly reached out and placed the queen in the box and stepped back. As she stepped away, the bees started to lift off of her, buzzing in the air, waiting to pick up the new signal of the queen\u2019s location. Then one by one, they found her, and rapidly flew towards the box, covering the table in seconds.\n\nMilly let out a deep breath and looked at her friends and family. She dropped the hand from over her mouth, and helped a few bees that were stuck in her hair find their way out. She had the biggest smile on her face, like only a happy 6 year old can have, and she asked, \u201cWho likes honey?\u201d"}]}

A significant number of historians have stated that Salamis is one of the most significant battles in human history (though the same is often stated of Marathon). In a more extreme form of this argument, some historians argue that if the Greeks had lost at Salamis, the ensuing conquest of Greece by the Persians would have effectively stifled the growth of Western Civilization as we know it. This view is based on the premise that much of modern Western society, such as philosophy, science, personal freedom and democracy are rooted in the legacy of Ancient Greece. Thus, this school of thought argues that, given the domination of much of modern history by Western Civilization, Persian domination of Greece might have changed the whole trajectory of human history. It is also worth mentioning that the celebrated blossoming of hugely influential Athenian culture occurred only after the Persian wars were won.\n\nFrom: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Salamis\n\n### Response:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "The battle (fought between the Persian Empire and Greek City-States in 480 BC) is still considered by many historians to be a foundational event in the development of Western Civilization and modern Democracy.  Some say that if the Greeks had lost at Salamis it could have had profound effects on the trajectory of human history.  Historian's trace back much of today's Western ideals in philosophy, culture, politics, and science to Ancient Greece.  They deduce that if Persia had won the Greco-Persian wars it could have oppressed the blossoming of many modern Western schools of thought.  \n\nSalamis is one of many skirmishes fought over the course of almost half a century during this conflict.  There were other pivotal battles that contributed to the Greek victory, like Marathon and Plataea.  However, if Salamis had been won by the Persians, the Greek navy would have been unable to stop them from establishing beachheads across Greece.  Much of the Greek victory has been attributed to their use of the environment to their advantage; leveraging natural chokepoints (like at Salamis) to reduce the effectiveness of Persia's numerical advantage.  Had Salamis fallen to the Persians it's reasonable to assume that this strategy would have failed and Persia's massive armies would have been able to dominate the Greeks.  \n\nIt's also impossible to predict the outcome of the war if Persia had won this battle, even though chances are things would have ended very differently.  Salamis is perhaps more highly regarded because of the long odds the Greek navy faced.  They were able to prevail despite being largely outnumbered, which could also be why it's considered such a remarkable event."}]}

A prominent cultural figure of the 20th and 21st centuries, Madonna remains one of the most \"well-documented figures of the modern age\", with a broad amount of scholarly reviews and literature works on her, as well as an academic mini subdiscipline devoted to her named Madonna studies.\n\nMadonna moved to New York City in 1978 to pursue a career in modern dance. After performing as a drummer, guitarist, and vocalist in the rock bands Breakfast Club and Emmy, she rose to solo stardom with her debut studio album, Madonna (1983). She followed it with a series of successful albums, including all-time bestsellers Like a Virgin (1984), True Blue (1986) and The Immaculate Collection (1990), as well as Grammy Award winners Ray of Light (1998) and Confessions on a Dance Floor (2005). Madonna has amassed many chart-topping singles throughout her career, including \"Like a Virgin\", \"La Isla Bonita\", \"Like a Prayer\", \"Vogue\", \"Take a Bow\", \"Frozen\", \"Music\", \"Hung Up\", and \"4 Minutes\".\n\nMadonna's popularity was enhanced by roles in films such as Desperately Seeking Susan (1985), Dick Tracy (1990), A League of Their Own (1992), and Evita (1996). While Evita won her a Golden Globe Award for Best Actress, many of her other films were not as well received. As a businesswoman, Madonna founded the company Maverick in 1992. It included Maverick Records, one of the most successful artist-run labels in history. Her other ventures include fashion brands, written works, health clubs, and filmmaking. She contributes to various charities, having founded the Ray of Light Foundation in 1998 and Raising Malawi in 2006.\n\nWith sales of over 300 million records worldwide, Madonna is the best-selling female recording artist of all time. She is the most successful solo artist in the history of the U.S. Billboard Hot 100 chart and has achieved the most number-one singles by a woman in Australia, Canada, Italy, Spain, and the United Kingdom. With a revenue of over US$1.5 billion from her concert tickets, she remains the highest-grossing female touring artist worldwide. Forbes has named Madonna the annual top-earning female musician a record 11 times across four decades (1980s\u20132010s). She was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 2008, her first year of eligibility. Madonna was ranked as the greatest woman in music by VH1, and as the greatest music video artist ever by MTV and Billboard. Rolling Stone also listed her among its greatest artists and greatest songwriters of all time."}]}

Essentially nearly all numbers start with 0 when dialled in the UK. The leading 0 is omitted when calling from overseas and the prefix \"+44\" is added in its place. The second digit indicates what type of number it is. So called geographic numbers (those associated with an area code) start with 01or 02. Numbers starting with 03 are not associated with any area code but are charged at the same rates as numbers beginning with 01 or 02. Mobile numbers always start with 07. Numbers starting 09 are premium rate numbers which incur high charges for providing additional services.  Numbers starting with 080 are toll free. Other numbers starting with 08 are charged at special rates but not the very high rates for 09 numbers.\n\nSpecial numbers that do not start with 0 include 999 and 112 for emergencies, 101 for non emergency Police matters, 111 for contacting the National Health Service in a non emergency and directory enquiries services that start with 118.\n\nThe history of UK area codes (beginning 01 and 02) dates back to the times when individual telephone exchanges had their own one, two or three character Subscriber Trunk Dialing (STD) codes (e.g. B for Birmingham or AY6 for Aylesbury). in 1966 STD codes were converted to numbers using the number patterns on telephone dials (where 2=ABC, 3 = DEF etc.) so Birmingham became 021, Aylesbury became 0296. 01 was the code allocated to London. Area codes were between 2 and five characters long including the leading zero. Following the area code a local number of between 3 and 7 digits was added for each line to make the complete number either 9 or 10 digits long. Callers within the same area code could dial other lines with the same code by simply dialling the local number omitting the area code. In 1968 area codes beginning 00 were moved to free up 00 for other uses.\n\nBy the 1980s a number of factors meant that some areas, especially London, were running out of codes. Various measures were introduced including, in 1990,  the splitting of London into 071 (inner London) and 081 (outer London).\n\nThe 80s and 90s also saw the gradual introduction of \"non geographic\" numbers e.g. the toll free 0800 numbers and a number of patterns for emerging mobile services. Premium rate services were also launched using 0898.\n\nIn 1995 on so called \"phONEday\" a leading 1 was added after the zero. London numbers became either 0171 or 0181, Birmingham 0121, Aylesbury 01296 etc.\n\nThis established the pattern we see today allowing for some area codes to move to \"02\" codes over the next few years. In addition larger cities were allocated new codes beginning 011 e.g. 0113 for Leeds, 0117 for Bristol.\n\nIn 2000 the \"big number change\" saw London codes changed yet again = 0171 became 020 7 and 0181 became 020 8 allowing for new London numbers to be issued starting with 020 3 and 020 4 . Other cities that gained \"02\" style codes were Southampton/Portsmouth 023 , Coventry 024 and Cardiff 029.  A unified code of 028 was introduced in Northern Ireland."}]}

Also, advances to ski equipment and slope grooming technology make skiing a lot safer than it used to be years ago.\n\nLearning to ski as an adult may take longer than learning as a child. It is recommended that you start with some lessons first to gain the right technique. This could be group lessons or private lessons. You could also learn from friends who know how to ski, or learn by watching online tutorials and applying them yourself on the mountain. Once you have the basic skills, you should be able to ski easy slopes and start enjoying skiing as a fun activity. \n\nIn addition to lessons, you will also need the right gear to ski. This includes appropriate clothing that can keep you warm on the mountain while you ski, as well as ski equipment that you will use. It is recommended that you get a pair of skis and poles, good fitting boots, a helmet for safety, and goggles to protect your eyes from the elements. Renting your equipment is a good option when you're starting. That way you are not making an expensive commitment upfront. You could also buy your equipment either new or from any of the second-hand ski shops and ski swaps.\n \nWith the right gear and knowledge of the basics, you can take your learning in any direction you want. Many people choose to stay at a beginner or intermediate level and just enjoy the occasional ski trip with friends. While others take their passion forward with more practice, hours on the mountain, and likely more lessons to get to advanced levels.\n\nWhichever path you pick, skiing can be a fun sport to learn and enjoy for the rest of your life.

Generally, corporate defensive measures relate to measures for a company to consider to protect against (1) hostile takeovers that the board believes do not reflect the value of the company and (2) short-termism, where there is pressure from public investors \u2013 particularly activist investors \u2013 to take board actions (or face the risk of being voted off the board) that the board believes are not in the best interest of the company and its stockholders and maximizing value over the long term.  Corporate defensive measures generally aren\u2019t relevant when a company is private given the corporate structure with significant long-term investor representation on the board and various agreements in place with stockholders.  However, these measures become relevant once a company has public stockholders, so many companies who are considering an initial public offering will assess what types of defensive measures would be appropriate for them.\n\nA classified board is viewed as corporate defensive measure (i.e., it\u2019s an anti-takeover and activist defense) as the entire board can\u2019t be replaced in a single election cycle (with 3 classes, it would take up to the 3rd election cycle for the full board to be replaced, and generally 2 years to capture a majority)."}]}

He is the husband of Hillary Clinton, who was a U.S. senator from New York from 2001 to 2009, secretary of state from 2009 to 2013 and the Democratic nominee for president in the 2016 presidential election.\n\nClinton was born and raised in Arkansas and attended Georgetown University. He received a Rhodes Scholarship to study at University College, Oxford, and later graduated from Yale Law School. He met Hillary Rodham at Yale; they married in 1975. After graduating from law school, Clinton returned to Arkansas and won election as state attorney general, followed by two non-consecutive tenures as Arkansas governor. As governor, he overhauled the state's education system and served as chairman of the National Governors Association. Clinton was elected president in the 1992 presidential election, defeating incumbent Republican president George H. W. Bush and independent businessman Ross Perot. At 46 years old, he became the third-youngest president of the United States and the first president to be born in the Baby Boomer generation.\n\nClinton presided over the longest period of peacetime economic expansion in American history. He signed into law the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) and the Violent Crime Control and Law Enforcement Act, but failed to pass his plan for national health care reform. The Republican Party won unified control of Congress for the first time in 40 years in the 1994 elections, but Clinton was still comfortably re-elected in 1996, becoming the first Democrat since Franklin D. Roosevelt to win a second full term. Starting in the mid-1990s, he began an ideological evolution as he became much more conservative in his domestic policy, advocating for and signing the Personal Responsibility and Work Opportunity Act, the State Children's Health Insurance Program and financial deregulation measures. He appointed Ruth Bader Ginsburg and Stephen Breyer to the U.S. Supreme Court. During the last three years of Clinton's presidency, the Congressional Budget Office reported a budget surplus\u2014the first such surplus since 1969. In foreign policy, Clinton ordered U.S. military intervention in the Bosnian and Kosovo wars, eventually signing the Dayton Peace agreement. He also called for the expansion of NATO in Eastern Europe and many former Warsaw Pact members joined NATO during his presidency. Clinton's foreign policy in the Middle East saw him sign the Iraq Liberation Act which gave aid to groups against Saddam Hussein. He also participated in the Oslo I Accord and Camp David Summit to advance the Israeli\u2013Palestinian peace process, and assisted the Northern Ireland peace process.\n\nClinton's second term was dominated by the Monica Lewinsky scandal, which began in 1996, when he had a sexual relationship with 22-year-old Monica Lewinsky, an intern at the White House. In January 1998, news of the affair made tabloid headlines. This scandal escalated throughout the year, culminating on December 19 when Clinton was impeached by the House of Representatives, becoming the second U.S. president\u2014the first since Andrew Johnson\u2014to be impeached. The two impeachment articles that the House passed were centered around him using the powers of the presidency to obstruct the investigation and lying under oath. In 1999, Clinton's impeachment trial began in the Senate. He was acquitted on both charges as the Senate failed to cast 67 votes against him, which was necessary to meet the two-thirds conviction threshold prescribed by Article I, section 3, clause 6 of the U.S. Constitution.\n\nClinton left office in 2001 with the joint-highest approval rating of any U.S. president in the modern era, alongside Franklin D. Roosevelt and Ronald Reagan. His presidency has been ranked among the upper tier in historical rankings of U.S. presidents. However, his personal conduct and allegations of sexual assault have made him the subject of substantial scrutiny. Since leaving office, Clinton has been involved in public speaking and humanitarian work. He created the Clinton Foundation to address international causes such as the prevention of HIV/AIDS and global warming. In 2009, he was named the United Nations Special Envoy to Haiti. After the 2010 Haiti earthquake, Clinton and George W. Bush formed the Clinton Bush Haiti Fund. He has remained active in Democratic Party politics, campaigning for his wife's 2008 and 2016 presidential campaigns."}]}

Brent Musburger, a former sportswriter from Chicago, brought the term \"March Madness\" to the NCAA tournament when covering the event for CBS in 1982. The phrase became synonymous with the tournament ever since. In 2010, the NCAA made it official and paid IHSA (The Illinois High School Association) $17.2M for the rights to the phrase, and began using the trademark in marketing materials, logos and other branding material. While only used for the men's tournament for decades, the NCAA only began using the phrase \"March Madness\" for the women's tournament in 2022."}]}

Ancient Egyptian texts dating from 2750 BCE referred to these fish as the \"Thunderer of the Nile\", and described them as the \"protectors\" of all other fish. Electric fish were again reported millennia later by ancient Greek, Roman and Arabic naturalists and physicians. Several ancient writers, such as Pliny the Elder and Scribonius Largus, attested to the numbing effect of electric shocks delivered by electric catfish and electric rays, and knew that such shocks could travel along conducting objects. Patients with ailments such as gout or headache were directed to touch electric fish in the hope that the powerful jolt might cure them.\nAncient cultures around the Mediterranean knew that certain objects, such as rods of amber, could be rubbed with cat's fur to attract light objects like feathers. Thales of Miletus made a series of observations on static electricity around 600 BCE, from which he believed that friction rendered amber magnetic, in contrast to minerals such as magnetite, which needed no rubbing.\nThales was incorrect in believing the attraction was due to a magnetic effect, but later science would prove a link between magnetism and electricity. According to a controversial theory, the Parthians may have had knowledge of electroplating, based on the 1936 discovery of the Baghdad Battery, which resembles a galvanic cell, though it is uncertain whether the artifact was electrical in nature.\nElectricity would remain little more than an intellectual curiosity for millennia until 1600, when the English scientist William Gilbert wrote De Magnete, in which he made a careful study of electricity and magnetism, distinguishing the lodestone effect from static electricity produced by rubbing amber. He coined the New Latin word electricus (\"of amber\" or \"like amber\",, elektron, the Greek word for \"amber\") to refer to the property of attracting small objects after being rubbed. This association gave rise to the English words \"electric\" and \"electricity\", which made their first appearance in print in Thomas Browne's Pseudodoxia Epidemica of 1646.\nFurther work was conducted in the 17th and early 18th centuries by Otto von Guericke, Robert Boyle, Stephen Gray and C. F. du Fay. Later in the 18th century, Benjamin Franklin conducted extensive research in electricity, selling his possessions to fund his work. In June 1752 he is reputed to have attached a metal key to the bottom of a dampened kite string and flown the kite in a storm-threatened sky. A succession of sparks jumping from the key to the back of his hand showed that lightning was indeed electrical in nature. He also explained the apparently paradoxical behavior of the Leyden jar as a device for storing large amounts of electrical charge in terms of electricity consisting of both positive and negative charges\nIn 1775, Hugh Williamson reported a series of experiments to the Royal Society on the shocks delivered by the electric eel; that same year the surgeon and anatomist John Hunter described the structure of the fish's electric organs. In 1791, Luigi Galvani published his discovery of bioelectromagnetics, demonstrating that electricity was the medium by which neurons passed signals to the muscles. Alessandro Volta's battery, or voltaic pile, of 1800, made from alternating layers of zinc and copper, provided scientists with a more reliable source of electrical energy than the electrostatic machines previously used. The recognition of electromagnetism, the unity of electric and magnetic phenomena, is due to Hans Christian \u00d8rsted and Andr\u00e9-Marie Amp\u00e8re in 1819\u20131820. Michael Faraday invented the electric motor in 1821, and Georg Ohm mathematically analysed the electrical circuit in 1827. Electricity and magnetism (and light) were definitively linked by James Clerk Maxwell, in particular in his \"On Physical Lines of Force\" in 1861 and 1862.\u200a\nWhile the early 19th century had seen rapid progress in electrical science, the late 19th century would see the greatest progress in electrical engineering. Through such people as Alexander Graham Bell, Ott\u00f3 Bl\u00e1thy, Thomas Edison, Galileo Ferraris, Oliver Heaviside, \u00c1nyos Jedlik, William Thomson, 1st Baron Kelvin, Charles Algernon Parsons, Werner von Siemens, Joseph Swan, Reginald Fessenden, Nikola Tesla and George Westinghouse, electricity turned from a scientific curiosity into an essential tool for modern life.\nIn 1887, Heinrich Hertz discovered that electrodes illuminated with ultraviolet light create electric sparks more easily. In 1905, Albert Einstein published a paper that explained experimental data from the photoelectric effect as being the result of light energy being carried in discrete quantized packets, energising electrons. This discovery led to the quantum revolution. Einstein was awarded the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1921 for \"his discovery of the law of the photoelectric effect\". The photoelectric effect is also employed in photocells such as can be found in solar panels.\nThe first solid-state device was the \"cat's-whisker detector\" first used in the 1900s in radio receivers. A whisker-like wire is placed lightly in contact with a solid crystal (such as a germanium crystal) to detect a radio signal by the contact junction effect. In a solid-state component, the current is confined to solid elements and compounds engineered specifically to switch and amplify it. Current flow can be understood in two forms: as negatively charged electrons, and as positively charged electron deficiencies called holes. These charges and holes are understood in terms of quantum physics. The building material is most often a crystalline semiconductor.\nSolid-state electronics came into its own with the emergence of transistor technology. The first working transistor, a germanium-based point-contact transistor, was invented by John Bardeen and Walter Houser Brattain at Bell Labs in 1947, followed by the bipolar junction transistor in 1948.\n\n"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Further work was conducted in the 17th and early 18th centuries by Otto von Guericke, Robert Boyle, Stephen Gray and C.

It is located in the northeast Caribbean Sea, approximately 1,000 miles (1,600 km) southeast of Miami, Florida, between the Dominican Republic and the U.S. Virgin Islands, and includes the eponymous main island and several smaller islands, such as Mona, Culebra, and Vieques. It has roughly 3.2 million residents, and its capital and most populous city is San Juan. Spanish and English are the official languages of the executive branch of government, though Spanish predominates.\n\nPuerto Rico was settled by a succession of indigenous peoples beginning 2,000 to 4,000 years ago; these included the Ortoiroid, Saladoid, and Ta\u00edno. It was then colonized by Spain following the arrival of Christopher Columbus in 1493. Puerto Rico was contested by other European powers, but remained a Spanish possession for the next four centuries. An influx of African slaves and settlers primarily from the Canary Islands and Andalusia vastly changed the cultural and demographic landscape of the island. Within the Spanish Empire, Puerto Rico played a secondary but strategic role compared to wealthier colonies like Peru and New Spain. By the late 19th century, a distinct Puerto Rican identity began to emerge, centered around a fusion of indigenous, African, and European elements. In 1898, following the Spanish\u2013American War, Puerto Rico was acquired by the United States.\n\nPuerto Ricans have been U.S. citizens since 1917, and can move freely between the island and the mainland. However, as residents of an unincorporated territory, American citizens of Puerto Rico are disenfranchised at the national level, do not vote for the president or vice president, and generally do not pay federal income tax.[Note 1] In common with four other territories, Puerto Rico sends a nonvoting representative to the U.S. Congress, called a Resident Commissioner, and participates in presidential primaries; as it is not a state, Puerto Rico does not have a vote in Congress, which governs it under the Puerto Rico Federal Relations Act of 1950. Congress approved a local constitution in 1952, allowing U.S. citizens residing on the island to elect a governor. Puerto Rico's current and future political status has consistently been a matter of significant debate.\n\nAnswer:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "No, Puerto Rico is not a US state.

Bank reserves are held as cash in the bank or as balances in the bank's account at the central bank. The country's central bank determines the minimum amount that banks must hold in liquid assets, called the \"reserve requirement\" or \"reserve ratio\". Most commercial banks hold more than this minimum amount as excess reserves.\n\nBank deposits are usually of a relatively short-term duration, and may be \"at call\", while loans made by banks tend to be longer-term, resulting in a risk that customers may at any time collectively wish to withdraw cash out of their accounts in excess of the bank reserves. The reserves only provide liquidity to cover withdrawals within the normal pattern. Banks and the central bank expect that in normal circumstances only a proportion of deposits will be withdrawn at the same time, and that reserves will be sufficient to meet the demand for cash. However, banks may find themselves in a shortfall situation when depositors wish to withdraw more funds than the reserves held by the bank. In that event, the bank experiencing the liquidity shortfall may borrow short-term funds in the interbank lending market from banks with a surplus. In exceptional situations, such as during an unexpected bank run, the central bank may provide funds to cover the short-term shortfall as lender of last resort."}]}

As you are hitting a bump, you want to keep your back as straight as possible and let your hip and knee take the impact. The movement pattern is similar to squatting down, where you want to drop your bottom down towards your ankle. The reason you want your knee and hip to take the impact is because those joints have much bigger range of motion compared to your back so as you hit a bump or mogul, those joints will help absorb the majority of the irregularity in the terrain so your back is not needing to move as much which will help reduce the strain being put on it."}]}

Fremont people and Ancestral Puebloans lived in the area until about 700 years ago. Spanish missionaries encountered Ute and Paiute tribes in the area when they first came through in 1775, but the first European-Americans to attempt settlement in the area were the Mormon Elk Mountain Mission in 1855, who soon abandoned the area. Ranchers, farmers, and prospectors later settled Moab in the neighboring Riverine Valley in the late 1870s. Word of the beauty of the surrounding rock formations spread beyond the settlement as a possible tourist destination.\n\nThe Arches area was first brought to the attention of the National Park Service by Frank A. Wadleigh, passenger traffic manager of the Denver and Rio Grande Western Railroad. Wadleigh, accompanied by railroad photographer George L. Beam, visited the area in September 1923 at the invitation of Alexander Ringhoffer, a Hungarian-born prospector living in Salt Valley. Ringhoffer had written to the railroad to interest them in the tourist potential of a scenic area he had discovered the previous year with his two sons and a son-in-law, which he called the Devils Garden (known today as the Klondike Bluffs). Wadleigh was impressed by what Ringhoffer showed him, and suggested to Park Service director Stephen T. Mather that the area be made a national monument.\n\nThe following year, additional support for the monument idea came from Laurence Gould, a University of Michigan graduate student (and future polar explorer) studying the geology of the nearby La Sal Mountains, who was shown the scenic area by local physician Dr. J. W. \"Doc\" Williams.\n\nA succession of government investigators examined the area, in part due to confusion as to the precise location. In the process, the name Devils Garden was transposed to an area on the opposite side of Salt Valley that includes Landscape Arch, the longest arch in the park. Ringhoffer's original discovery was omitted, while another area nearby, known locally as the Windows, was included. Designation of the area as a national monument was supported by the Park Service in 1926 but was resisted by President Calvin Coolidge's Interior Secretary, Hubert Work. Finally, in April 1929, shortly after his inauguration, President Herbert Hoover signed a presidential proclamation creating the Arches National Monument, consisting of two comparatively small, disconnected sections. The purpose of the reservation under the 1906 Antiquities Act was to protect the arches, spires, balanced rocks, and other sandstone formations for their scientific and educational value. The name Arches was suggested by Frank Pinkely, superintendent of the Park Service's southwestern national monuments, following a visit to the Windows section in 1925.\n\nIn late 1938, President Franklin D. Roosevelt signed a proclamation that enlarged the Arches to protect additional scenic features and permit the development of facilities to promote tourism. A small adjustment was made by President Dwight Eisenhower in 1960 to accommodate a new road alignment.\n\nIn early 1969, just before leaving office, President Lyndon B. Johnson signed a proclamation substantially enlarging the Arches. Two years later, President Richard Nixon signed legislation enacted by Congress, which significantly reduced the total area enclosed, but changed its status. Arches National Park was formally dedicated in May 1972.\n\nIn 1980, vandals attempted to use an abrasive kitchen cleanser to deface ancient petroglyphs in the park, prompting park officials to recruit physicist John F. Asmus, who specialized in using lasers to restore works of art, to use his technology to repair the damage. Asmus \"zapped the panel with intense light pulses and succeeded in removing most of the cleanser\". In 2016, there was another vandalism event on Frame Arch in the park, where a section if the rock was carved out. Due to advances in technology, in 2018 the arch was repaired through color match and modern infilling methods.\n\nResponse:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "First Humans appeared in this region during the last ice age 10000 years ago.

Major elements of the changes include reducing tax rates for businesses and individuals, increasing the standard deduction and family tax credits, eliminating personal exemptions and making it less beneficial to itemize deductions, limiting deductions for state and local income taxes and property taxes, further limiting the mortgage interest deduction, reducing the alternative minimum tax for individuals and eliminating it for corporations, doubling the estate tax exemption, and set the penalty enforcing individual mandate of the Affordable Care Act (ACA) at $0.\n\nThe Act is based on tax reform advocated by congressional Republicans and the Trump administration.

Inspired by his Christian beliefs and the nonviolent activism of Mahatma Gandhi, he led targeted, nonviolent resistance against Jim Crow laws and other forms of discrimination in the United States.\nOutput:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Martin Luther King Jr. (born Michael King Jr.; January 15, 1929 \u2013 April 4, 1968) was an American Baptist minister and activist who was one of the most prominent leaders in the civil rights movement from 1955 until his assassination in 1968. A Black church leader and a son of early civil rights activist and minister Martin Luther King Sr., King advanced civil rights for people of color in the United States through nonviolence and civil disobedience. Inspired by his Christian beliefs and the nonviolent activism of Mahatma Gandhi, he led targeted, nonviolent resistance against Jim Crow laws and other forms of discrimination in the United States.\n\nKing participated in and led marches for the right to vote, desegregation, labor rights, and other civil rights. He oversaw the 1955 Montgomery bus boycott and later became the first president of the Southern Christian Leadership Conference (SCLC). As president of the SCLC, he led the unsuccessful Albany Movement in Albany, Georgia, and helped organize some of the nonviolent 1963 protests in Birmingham, Alabama. King was one of the leaders of the 1963 March on Washington, where he delivered his \"I Have a Dream\" speech on the steps of the Lincoln Memorial. The civil rights movement achieved pivotal legislative gains in the Civil Rights Act of 1964, Voting Rights Act of 1965, and the Fair Housing Act of 1968.\n\nThe SCLC put into practice the tactics of nonviolent protest with some success by strategically choosing the methods and places in which protests were carried out. There were several dramatic standoffs with segregationist authorities, who frequently responded violently. King was jailed several times. Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) director J. Edgar Hoover considered King a radical and made him an object of the FBI's COINTELPRO from 1963 forward. FBI agents investigated him for possible communist ties, spied on his personal life, and secretly recorded him. In 1964, the FBI mailed King a threatening anonymous letter, which he interpreted as an attempt to make him commit suicide.\n\nOn October 14, 1964, King won the Nobel Peace Prize for combating racial inequality through nonviolent resistance. In 1965, he helped organize two of the three Selma to Montgomery marches. In his final years, he expanded his focus to include opposition towards poverty, capitalism, and the Vietnam War. In 1968, King was planning a national occupation of Washington, D.C., to be called the Poor People's Campaign, when he was assassinated on April 4 in Memphis, Tennessee. His death was followed by national mourning, as well as anger leading to riots in many U.S. cities. King was posthumously awarded the Presidential Medal of Freedom in 1977 and the Congressional Gold Medal in 2003. Martin Luther King Jr. Day was established as a holiday in cities and states throughout the United States beginning in 1971; the federal holiday was first observed in 1986. Hundreds of streets in the U.S. have been renamed in his honor, and King County in Washington was rededicated for him. The Martin Luther King Jr. Memorial on the National Mall in Washington, D.C., was dedicated in 2011."}]}

If she needs to sit for extended periods of time, she can change her position often; she should periodically walk around and gently perform stretches for her muscles to relieve tension. Secondly, outside of things she could do while sitting, she can consider performing exercises for lower back care.

It often uses a computer network to spread itself, relying on security failures on the target computer to access it. It will use this machine as a host to scan and infect other computers. When these new worm-invaded computers are controlled, the worm will continue to scan and infect other computers using these computers as hosts, and this behaviour will continue. Computer worms use recursive methods to copy themselves without host programs and distribute themselves based on exploiting the advantages of exponential growth, thus controlling and infecting more and more computers in a short time. Worms almost always cause at least some harm to the network, even if only by consuming bandwidth, whereas viruses almost always corrupt or modify files on a targeted computer.\n\nMany worms are designed only to spread, and do not attempt to change the systems they pass through. However, as the Morris worm and Mydoom showed, even these \"payload-free\" worms can cause major disruption by increasing network traffic and other unintended effects.\n\nHistory\n\nThe actual term \"worm\" was first used in John Brunner's 1975 novel, The Shockwave Rider. In the novel, Nichlas Haflinger designs and sets off a data-gathering worm in an act of revenge against the powerful men who run a national electronic information web that induces mass conformity. \"You have the biggest-ever worm loose in the net, and it automatically sabotages any attempt to monitor it. There's never been a worm with that tough a head or that long a tail!\"\n\nThe second ever computer worm was devised to be an anti-virus software. Named Reaper, it was created by Ray Tomlinson to replicate itself across the ARPANET and delete the experimental Creeper program (the first computer worm, 1971).\n\nOn November 2, 1988, Robert Tappan Morris, a Cornell University computer science graduate student, unleashed what became known as the Morris worm, disrupting many computers then on the Internet, guessed at the time to be one tenth of all those connected. During the Morris appeal process, the U.S. Court of Appeals estimated the cost of removing the worm from each installation at between $200 and $53,000; this work prompted the formation of the CERT Coordination Center and Phage mailing list. Morris himself became the first person tried and convicted under the 1986 Computer Fraud and Abuse Act.\n\nOutput:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "The first computer worm publicly known to cause real disruptions and malfunctioning to computers connected to the Internet is known to be the Morris worm, created in 1988 by Robert Morris, a computer science student at Cornell University."}]}

A Democrat from Texas, Johnson also served as a U.S. representative, U.S. Senator and the Senate's majority leader. He holds the distinction of being one of the few presidents who served in all elected offices at the federal level.\n\n"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Lyndon Baines Johnson (/\u02c8l\u026and\u0259n \u02c8be\u026anz/; August 27, 1908 \u2013 January 22, 1973), often referred to by his initials LBJ, was an American politician who served as the 36th president of the United States from 1963 to 1969. He previously served as the 37th vice president from 1961 to 1963 under President John F. Kennedy, and was sworn in shortly after Kennedy's assassination. A Democrat from Texas, Johnson also served as a U.S. representative, U.S. Senator and the Senate's majority leader. He holds the distinction of being one of the few presidents who served in all elected offices at the federal level.\n\nBorn in a farmhouse in Stonewall, Texas, to a local political family, Johnson worked as a high school teacher and a congressional aide before winning election to the U.S. House of Representatives in 1937. In 1948, he won the 1948 Senate election in Texas after a narrow and controversial victory in the Democratic Party's primary. He was appointed to the position of Senate Majority Whip in 1951. He became the Senate Democratic leader in 1953 and majority leader in 1954. In 1960 Johnson ran for the Democratic nomination for president. Ultimately, Senator Kennedy bested Johnson and his other rivals for the nomination, then surprised many by offering to make Johnson his vice presidential running mate. The Kennedy-Johnson ticket won in the 1960 presidential election. Vice President Johnson assumed the presidency on November 22, 1963, after President Kennedy was assassinated. The following year Johnson was elected to the presidency when he won in a landslide against Arizona Senator Barry Goldwater, receiving 61.1% of the popular vote in the 1964 presidential election, the largest share won by any presidential candidate since the 1820 election.\n\nJohnson's domestic policy was aimed at expanding civil rights, public broadcasting, access to healthcare, aid to education and the arts, urban and rural development, and public services. In 1964 Johnson coined the term the \"Great Society\" to describe these efforts. In addition, he sought to create better living conditions for low-income Americans by spearheading a campaign unofficially called the \"War on Poverty\". As part of these efforts, Johnson signed the Social Security Amendments of 1965, which resulted in the creation of Medicare and Medicaid. Johnson followed his predecessor's actions in bolstering NASA and made the Apollo Program a national priority. He enacted the Higher Education Act of 1965 which established federally insured student loans. Johnson signed the Immigration and Nationality Act of 1965 which laid the groundwork for U.S. immigration policy today. Johnson's opinion on the issue of civil rights put him at odds with other white, southern Democrats. His civil rights legacy was shaped by signing the Civil Rights Act of 1964, the Voting Rights Act of 1965, and the Civil Rights Act of 1968. During his presidency, the American political landscape transformed significantly, as white southerners who were once staunch Democrats began moving to the Republican Party and black voters began moving to the Democratic Party. Because of his domestic agenda, Johnson's presidency marked the peak of modern liberalism in the United States.\n\nJohnson's presidency took place during the Cold War, thus his foreign policy prioritized containment of communism. Prior to his presidency, the U.S. was already involved in the Vietnam War, supporting South Vietnam against the communist North. Following a naval skirmish in 1964 between the United States and North Vietnam, Congress passed the Gulf of Tonkin Resolution, which granted Johnson the power to launch a full-scale military intervention in South East Asia. The number of American military personnel in Vietnam increased dramatically, and casualties soared among U.S. soldiers and Vietnamese civilians. Johnson also expanded military operations in neighboring Laos to destroy North Vietnamese supply lines. In 1968, the communist Tet Offensive inflamed the anti-war movement, especially among draft-age students on university campuses, and public opinion turned against America's involvement in the war. In Europe, Johnson's administration continued to promote and foster Western European political and economic cooperation and integration as his predecessors had.\n\nAt home, Johnson faced further troubles with race riots in major cities and increasing crime rates. His political opponents seized the opportunity and raised demands for \"law and order\" policies. Johnson began his presidency with near-universal support, but his approval declined throughout his presidency as the public became frustrated with both the Vietnam War and domestic unrest. Johnson initially sought to run for re-election; however, following disappointing results in the New Hampshire primary he withdrew his candidacy. The war was a major election issue and the 1968 presidential election saw Republican candidate Richard Nixon defeat Johnson's vice president Hubert Humphrey. At the end of his presidency in 1969, Johnson returned to his Texas ranch, published his memoirs, and in other respects kept a low profile until he died of a heart attack in 1973.\n\nJohnson is one of the most controversial presidents in American history. Public opinion and academic assessments of his legacy have fluctuated greatly ever since his death. Historians and scholars rank Johnson in the upper tier because of his accomplishments regarding domestic policy. His administration passed many major laws that made substantial changes in civil rights, health care, welfare, and education. Conversely, Johnson is strongly criticized for his foreign policy, namely escalating American involvement in the Vietnam War."}]}

It is sometimes called Earth's \"sister\" or \"twin\" planet as it is almost as large and has a similar composition. As an interior planet to Earth, Venus (like Mercury) appears in Earth's sky never far from the Sun, either as morning star or evening star. Aside from the Sun and Moon, Venus is the brightest natural object in Earth's sky, capable of casting visible shadows on Earth in dark conditions and being visible to the naked eye in broad daylight.\n\nVenus is the second largest terrestrial object of the Solar System. It has a surface gravity slightly lower than on Earth and has a weak induced magnetosphere. The atmosphere of Venus consists mainly of carbon dioxide, and, at the planet\u2019s surface, is the densest and hottest of the atmospheres of the four terrestrial planets. With an atmospheric pressure at the planet's surface of about 92 times the sea level pressure of Earth and a mean temperature of 737 K (464 \u00b0C; 867 \u00b0F), the carbon dioxide gas at Venus's surface is a supercritical fluid. Venus is shrouded by an opaque layer of highly reflective clouds of sulfuric acid, making it the planet with the highest albedo in the Solar System. It may have had water oceans in the past, but after these evaporated the temperature rose under a runaway greenhouse effect. The possibility of life on Venus has long been a topic of speculation but research has not produced convincing evidence thus far.\n\nLike Mercury, Venus does not have any moons. Solar days on Venus, with a length of 117 Earth days, are just about half as long as its solar year, orbiting the Sun every 224.7 Earth days. This Venusian daylength is a product of it rotating against its orbital motion, halving its full sidereal rotation period of 243 Earth days, the longest of all the Solar System planets. Venus and Uranus are the only planets with such a retrograde rotation, making the Sun move in their skies from their western horizon to their eastern. The orbit of Venus around the Sun is the closest to Earth's orbit, bringing them closer than any other pair of planets. This occurs during inferior conjunction with a synodic period of 1.6 years. However, Mercury is more frequently the closest to each.\n\nOutput:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "- 224.7 Earth days to orbit the sun\n- Mean temperature of 737 K (464 \u00b0C; 867 \u00b0F)\n- No moons orbit Venus\n- Carbon dioxide is the primary element in the atmosphere"}]}

It derives from the movement of the sun from one position to another in the zodiac. According to its literal meaning in Sanskrit, a Songkran occurs every month. However, the period that Thai people refer to as Songkran happens when the sun moves from Pisces to Aries in the zodiac. The correct name for this period should actually be Maha Songkran ('great Songkran) because it coincides with the arrival of a New Year. The Songkran festival is, therefore, a celebration of the New Year in accordance with the solar calendar. The celebration covers a period of three days: 13 April is regarded as Maha Songkran, the day that the sun moves into Aries on the zodiac or the last day of the old year. The next day, 14 April is called Wan Nao, the transitional day between the old and the new years, and 15 April is called Wan Thaloeng Sok (Thai: \u0e27\u0e31\u0e19\u0e40\u0e16\u0e25\u0e34\u0e07\u0e28\u0e01 'to begin a new era or year'), New Year's day itself.\n\n"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Thai Songkran festival is a New Year celebration in Thailand according to solar calendar.

First held in 1923, the Spengler Cup is often cited as the oldest invitational ice hockey tournament in the world. The event is hosted by the Swiss team HC Davos and played each year in Davos from 26 December to 31 inclusively. Currently, all games are held at the Eisstadion Davos.\n\nIt was originally devised by Dr. Carl Spengler as a means to promote teams from German-speaking Europe, who might have suffered ostracism in the aftermath of World War I. Eventually, the tournament grew well beyond expectations. Many of Europe's most prestigious clubs and national programs have appeared, including Soviet, Czechoslovak, Swedish, German, and Finnish powerhouses. Through its history, club or national teams from 13 countries have won the tournament, with Team Canada winning the most cups as a club (16) while various teams from Switzerland have won the most cups for one country (20).\n\nAmong non-European organizations, Team Canada, Team USA, nationally ranked U.S. collegiate teams, reigning AHL Calder Cup and Ontario Hockey Association champions, and even Team Japan (in 1971, building international experience before playing as hosts of the 1972 Sapporo Winter Olympics) have competed for the Spengler Cup. Since at least 1990, Team Canada has been the only participant from North America, with the exception of the AHL's Rochester Americans in 1996 and 2013 (see AHL participation at the Spengler Cup).\n\nIn the 2018 tournament, Finnish club team KalPa from the city of Kuopio defeated Team Canada 2\u20131 in the final. The game was decided in the 8th round of a shootout, the first series of game-winning shots in tournament history that determined the winner of the Spengler Cup.\n\nThe Spengler Cup tournament was not played in 2020 or 2021 due to the COVID-19 pandemic. In the 2022 tournament, Swiss club team HC Ambr\u00ec-Piotta defeated Sparta Prague 3\u20132 in the final; with the game decided in the 5th round of a shootout."}]}

Rods connect the engines pistons to the journals of the crankshaft. The crankshaft is evenly balanced by  weights on the opposite side of each journal to ensure that at high revolutions per minute (RPM) the motor is stable. As the crankshaft rotates it pushes the rods up and down that are connected to pistons. At the front of the crankshaft is a gear, the gear is typically connected via a chain to the camshaft. If the crankshaft is the heart of the engine, a camshaft is the brain of the engine. The camshaft determines when to open and close valves that let in air and fuel into each cylinder and let out exhaust from the internal combustion. The camshaft is a shaft that runs the length of the engine and has lobes on it, small metal cylinders called lifters ride on these lobes and are connected to push rods, the push rods are connected to rockers which rock back and forth opening and closing valves in the cylinder heads. The valves are located in the cylinder heads that sit on top of the cylinders that the pistons are in. As the pistons rotate up, a valve (being driven by the camshaft) opens to bring fuel into the cylinder, when the valve closes a spark from a spark plug, ignites the fuel causing a mini explosion pushing the cylinder down, a second valve opens letting the exhaust from the mini explosion exit the engine. This in turn rotates the crankshaft, pushing another piston up where the process continues. An intake manifold is like the lungs of a motor, it breaths in air from the atmosphere and mixes it with just the right amount of fuel to create that mini explosion in the cylinder.  The timing of the air, fuel, spark delivery is critical if it is off just the smallest of margins the engine will not run at all."}]}

It is essential to all modern computing systems as it executes the commands and processes needed for your computer and operating system. The CPU is also important in determining how fast programs can run, from surfing the web to building spreadsheets. The GPU is a processor that is made up of many smaller and more specialized cores. By working together, the cores deliver massive performance when a processing task can be divided up and processed across many cores.\n\nWhile CPUs and GPUs have a lot in common - Both are critical computing engines. Both are silicon-based microprocessors. And both handle data - they do have different architectures and are built for different purposes.\n\nThe CPU is suited to a wide variety of workloads, especially those for which latency or per-core performance are important. A powerful execution engine, the CPU focuses its smaller number of cores on individual tasks and on getting things done quickly. This makes it uniquely well equipped for jobs ranging from serial computing to running databases.\n\nGPUs began as specialized ASICs developed to accelerate specific 3D rendering tasks. Over time, these fixed-function engines became more programmable and more flexible. While graphics and the increasingly lifelike visuals of today\u2019s top games remain their principal function, GPUs have evolved to become more general-purpose parallel processors as well, handling a growing range of applications."}]}

A budget is a financial plan meant to help us understand how much we can spend between paychecks and how much we can save.  If we have any high interest debt or any debt, the loan or bill with the highest accruing interest, that becomes the first priority for us to spend our budget on after we account for our expenses.

It stars Russell Crowe, Joaquin Phoenix, Connie Nielsen, Ralf M\u00f6ller, Oliver Reed (in his final role), Djimon Hounsou, Derek Jacobi, John Shrapnel, Richard Harris, and Tommy Flanagan. Crowe portrays Roman general Maximus Decimus Meridius, who is betrayed when Commodus, the ambitious son of Emperor Marcus Aurelius, murders his father and seizes the throne. Reduced to slavery, Maximus becomes a gladiator and rises through the ranks of the arena to avenge the murders of his family and his emperor.\n\nOutput:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "In 180 AD, Hispano-Roman General Maximus Decimus Meridius intends to return home after he leads the Roman army to victory against the Germanic tribes near Vindobona on the Limes Germanicus. Emperor Marcus Aurelius tells Maximus that his own son, Commodus, is unfit to rule and that he wishes Maximus to succeed him, as regent, to help save Rome from corruption and restore the republic. When told of this, Commodus privately murders his father.\n\nCommodus proclaims himself the new emperor, asking Maximus for his loyalty, but he refuses. Maximus is arrested by the Praetorian Guard and is told that he and his family will die. He kills his captors and, wounded, rides for his home near Turgalium (now Trujillo), where he finds his wife and son crucified. Maximus buries them, then collapses from his injuries. Slavers find him, and take him to the city of Zucchabar in the Roman province of Mauretania Caesariensis, where he is sold to gladiator trainer Proximo.\n\nMaximus reluctantly fights in local tournaments, his combat skills helping him win matches and gain popularity. He befriends two other gladiators: Hagen, a German; and Juba, a Numidian. Proximo reveals to Maximus that he was once a gladiator who was freed by Marcus Aurelius, and advises him to \"win the crowd\" to win his freedom.\n\nWhen Commodus organises 150 days of games to commemorate his father's death, Proximo takes his gladiators to Rome to fight in the Colosseum. Disguised in a masked helmet, Maximus debuts in the Colosseum as a Carthaginian in a re-enactment of the Battle of Zama. Unexpectedly, he leads his side to victory, and Commodus enters the Colosseum to offer his congratulations. He orders the disguised Maximus, as leader of the gladiators, to reveal his identity; Maximus removes his helmet and declares vengeance. Commodus is compelled by the crowd to let the gladiators live, and his guards are held back from striking them down.\n\nMaximus's next fight is against a legendary undefeated gladiator, Tigris of Gaul. Commodus arranges for several tigers to be set upon Maximus during the duel, but Maximus manages to prevail. Commodus orders Maximus to kill Tigris, but Maximus spares his opponent's life; in response, the crowd chants \"Maximus the Merciful\", angering Commodus.\n\nMaximus discovers from Cicero, his ex-orderly, that his former legions remain loyal. He meets in secret with Lucilla, Commodus's sister and once the lover of Maximus; and Gracchus, an influential senator. They agree to have Maximus escape Rome to join his legions, topple Commodus by force, and hand power back to the Roman Senate. Commodus learns of the plot when Lucilla's son, Lucius, innocently hints at the conspiracy. Commodus threatens Lucilla and Lucius, and has the Praetorian Guard arrest Gracchus and attack the gladiators' barracks. Proximo and his men, including Hagen, sacrifice themselves to enable Maximus to escape. Maximus is captured at the rendezvous with Cicero, where the latter is killed.\n\nIn an effort to win back public approval, Commodus challenges Maximus to a duel in the Colosseum. He stabs Maximus in the lung before the match to gain an advantage. Despite his injuries, Maximus disarms Commodus. After the Praetorian Guard refuses to aid him, Commodus unsheathes a hidden knife; Maximus overpowers Commodus and drives the knife into his throat, killing him. Before Maximus succumbs to his wounds, he asks for political reforms, for his gladiator allies to be freed, and for Senator Gracchus to be reinstated. As he dies, he has a vision where he reunites with his wife and son. His friends and allies honor him as \"a soldier of Rome\", at Lucilla's behest, and carry his body out of the arena, while the body of Commodus is left behind.\n\nThat night, Juba visits the Colosseum and buries figurines of Maximus's wife and son at the spot where he died."}]}

She confides in Poirot that she will soon be murdered, and that nothing can be done to stop it; after refusing Poirot's assistance, Jennie departs in distress, and Poirot is unable to find out anymore information from the staff about Jennie or her address. After returning to the guest house where he is staying, Poirot describes the events to Edward Catchpool, an officer at Scotland Yard - Catchpool reveals that he has spent the day investigating three murders at the luxurious Bloxham Hotel; two women and a man, all in separate rooms, were found dead earlier in the evening, each with a monogrammed cufflink (with the letters 'PJI') in their mouths.\n\nThe following day, Poirot and Catchpool attend the scene of the crime where they discover more details about the victims with the hotel's owner, Luca Lazzari; the victims (Harriet Sippel, Ida Gransbury and Richard Negus) had all arrived at the hotel separately on the same day; each victim was found in their locked hotel rooms; the murders occurred between 19:15 and 20:10 (all three victims were seen alive at 19:15 by hotel staff); Mr. Negus had booked the rooms for all three victims and paid for them ahead of time; a junior clerk saw Mr. Negus in the reception area 15 minutes after room service was provided for the victims. Later on, it's revealed that all three victims had lived in a village called Great Holling, and that Mr. Negus had been engaged to Ida - in addition, Richard had left Great Holling in 1913 after the deaths of the village vicar and his wife, Patrick and Frances Ives. Poirot sends Catchpool to Great Holling to discover more information about the victims. After arriving in the village, Catchpool meets Margaret Ernst, widow of the most recent vicar for the village. After some reluctance, Margaret relays to Catchpool the events of 1913. The vicar's maid had told Harriet Sippel a rumour that the vicar was taking money from villagers to help them 'communicate' with deceased loved ones. Harriet spread the rumour around the village, with the support of Ida and Mr. Negus. The rumours spiralled until there were calls to remove Ives as Vicar, and Frances' health declined as a result. Eventually, unable to bear the rumours any longer, Frances took her own life, with the heartbroken vicar following shortly afterwards. After some questioning, Catchpool learns that the maid who told the original lie was Jennie Hobbs - the same Jennie that Poirot has been searching for all this time.\n\nMeanwhile, as Catchpool is leaving London, Poirot arranges to meet with Nancy Ducane, a famous artist who was seen to be leaving the hotel shortly after the murders - Nancy was also mentioned in Margaret's story as the villager seen to be visiting the church at night with Ives. During the visit, Nancy recognises the names of various Great Holling residents but refuses to provide anymore details. However, Poirot and Constable Stanley Beer find a pair of keys that correspond to two of the victims' hotel rooms. Whilst visiting the home of Nancy's friend to confirm her alibi, Poirot notes several details from different paintings within the house. Shortly after returning home, Poirot learns from Scotland Yard that a fourth murder has occurred at the Bloxham - with Catchpool, the two gentlemen return to the hotel - they find a pool of blood, a monogrammed cufflink and (to Poirot's dismay) Jennie's hat within the room. After returning to their guest house, Poirot and Catchpool are visited by Nancy, who confesses her connection to the events in Great Holling; she was having an affair with Ives, and Jennie - who was also in love with the vicar - had spread the rumours out of jealousy. Nancy's attempts to placate the villagers by telling the truth were dismissed, and indeed further ruined the reputation of the vicar. The following day, Poirot takes Catchpool to visit the address of Samuel Kidd, the witness who saw Nancy at the hotel. However, instead of Samuel, they are greeted by Jennie Hobbs who - Poirot reveals - was formerly engaged to Samuel before she met the vicar. After listening to her testimony, Poirot and Catchpool return to Great Holling in response to a serious attack on Margaret - after speaking with the village doctor, Ambrose Flowerday, Poirot decides to return to the Bloxham one last time to resolve the case.\n\nAt the hotel, Poirot gathers the hotel staff and suspects together to reveal the solution; Nancy Ducane and Jennie Hobbs (with Kidd's assistance) had conspired to kill the three victims. Nancy & Kidd had impersonated Harriet & Mr. Negus at 19.15, and Kidd was the gentleman seen by the clerk at the front desk at 19.30. Nancy confesses to the crimes, but is fatally stabbed by Jennie. At Scotland Yard, Jennie, confesses her side of the story; In 1913, the rumour that Jennie had created was actually intended to save Ives from the scandal of his affair with Nancy. Harriet was convinced that the vicar could help her speak to her dead husband, and upon being refused, viciously spread the rumour in Great Holling. Years later, Mr. Negus contacted Jennie out of remorse for his actions, and the two people hatched a plan to kill all four guilty parties involved in the rumour. Mr. Negus and Jennie would lure Harriet and Ida to the Bloxham under false pretenses and poison them separately; Mr. Negus would then poison Jennie, and finally himself. However, Jennie secretly revealed the plan to Nancy to avoid her own death, and convinced Richard to die before her so that she could find justice against Nancy. Mr. Negus agreed to this plan, and Jennie arranged the scene to look like Mr. Negus had killed himself. Jennie had killed Nancy after she revealed at the meeting that her relationship with Ives had been a physical one, rather than the chaste romance that Jennie had been led to believe.\n\nFour days after Jennie and Kidd's arrest, Poirot and Catchpool receive a letter from Dr Flowerday and Margaret Ernst; they have harboured feelings for each other for years, and after Poirot's intervention have decided to marry.\nOutput:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "1.

Outside of the Cosmere, he has written several young adult and juvenile series including The Reckoners, the Skyward series, and the Alcatraz series. He is also known for finishing Robert Jordan's high fantasy series The Wheel of Time. Sanderson has created several graphic novel fantasy series, including White Sand and Dark One.\n\nHe created Sanderson's Laws of Magic and popularized the idea of \"hard magic\" and \"soft magic\" systems. In 2008, Sanderson started a podcast with author Dan Wells and cartoonist Howard Tayler called Writing Excuses, involving topics about creating genre writing and webcomics. In 2016, the American media company DMG Entertainment licensed the movie rights to Sanderson's entire Cosmere universe, but the rights have since reverted back to Sanderson.

The nutritional energy contained in fat, protein, and carbohydrates (also knowns as macronutrients or macros for short) is expressed in kilocalories (kcal or Cal) and makes up your daily caloric intake. Our bodies need the energy provided by these macronutrients to function properly. If you consume fewer calories than you burn, you will lose weight. On the other hand, if you consume more calories than you consume, you will gain weight. Calories are categorized as good or bad based on the sources, and its positive or negative impacts on our body. Negative impacts to body include increased risk of cardiovascular diseases, inflammation, and depression. Bad calories come from sources like meat, fat, sugar and processed foods. Good calories come from eating a whole-grain diet high in fruits, vegetables, legumes, fish, and nuts. That said, you should listen to your body, and do what feels right and avoid thinking in terms of \u201cgood\u201d or \u201cbad\u201d food.

Meno begins the dialogue by asking Socrates whether virtue is taught, acquired by practice, or comes by nature. In order to determine whether virtue is teachable or not, Socrates tells Meno that they first need to determine what virtue is. When the characters speak of virtue, or rather arete, they refer to virtue in general, rather than particular virtues, such as justice or temperance. The first part of the work showcases Socratic dialectical style; Meno, unable to adequately define virtue, is reduced to confusion or aporia. Socrates suggests that they seek an adequate definition for virtue together. In response, Meno suggests that it is impossible to seek what one does not know, because one will be unable to determine whether one has found it.\n\nSocrates challenges Meno's argument, often called \"Meno's Paradox\" or the \"Learner's Paradox\", by introducing the theory of knowledge as recollection (anamnesis). As presented in the dialogue, the theory proposes that souls are immortal and know all things in a disembodied state; learning in the embodied is actually a process of recollecting that which the soul knew before it came into a body. Socrates demonstrates recollection in action by posing a mathematical puzzle to one of Meno's slaves. Subsequently, Socrates and Meno return to the question of whether virtue is teachable, employing the method of hypothesis. Near the end of the dialogue, Meno poses another famous puzzle, called \"The Meno Problem\" or \"The Value Problem for Knowledge\", which questions why knowledge is valued more highly than true belief. In response, Socrates provides a famous and somewhat enigmatic distinction between knowledge and true belief.\n\nAnswer:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "- arete: virtues in general, i.e. instead of a particular virtue\n- aporia: confusion\n- anamnesis: recollection of knowledge"}]}

You will be amazed by the beautiful color of the Blue Grotto. However if you are going in high season, expect a wait to enter the Blue Grotto. Capri island has a lot to be discovered, and don't miss the funicular!\n\nDay 4: Visit 2 of the most beautiful manors on the Amalfi Coast in Ravello: Villa Cimbrone and Villa Rufolo. Have a meal there to enjoy the surroundings and the views. Then walk around the town of Ravello.\n\nDay 5: Go back to Naples for a day to enjoy the pizza, and historical city.

One way is to use a process called electrolysis to extract oxygen from water.\n\nWater: Water is essential for survival, so you'll need to find a source of water on Mars. This could be in the form of ice or underground reserves.\n\nFood: Growing your own food on Mars would be difficult, but not impossible. You could use hydroponics or aeroponics to grow plants indoors, or find ways to grow crops outdoors.\n\nShelter: Mars' harsh environment would require a well-built shelter to protect you from the extreme cold, radiation, and dust storms. The shelter would need to be well insulated and sealed to prevent air leaks.\n\nEnergy: You'll need a reliable source of energy to power your shelter and equipment. Solar panels could be used to generate electricity, or nuclear reactors could be used for more efficient energy production.\n\nCommunications: Communication with Earth would be crucial for survival. You would need a reliable communication system to send and receive messages from Earth, as well as to coordinate with other astronauts on Mars.\n\nMedical Supplies: Medical emergencies could arise on Mars, so having a well-stocked medical kit and the knowledge to treat basic medical issues would be important.\n\nMental Health: Living in isolation on Mars could take a toll on your mental health. Maintaining social connections with other astronauts, regular exercise, and engaging in activities to combat boredom would be important for mental health.\n\nSurviving on Mars would require a great deal of preparation, resources, and expertise. It would also require a strong will to persevere through the challenges of living on an inhospitable planet."}]}

While it is tempting to buy your dream supersport or touring cruiser, your first bike should be one that you can feel confident on so you can quickly master the skills necessary to ride a faster or larger bike more safely. Assess a new bike not from a place of desire, but from practical perspective, and consider these qualities:\n\n- Seat height: For most new riders, confidence comes more quickly when you can place both feet on the ground with a little bend in the knees. If you have a 32\" inseam, consider bikes with a 31\" or less seat height. If you have a 28\" inseam, consider bikes with a 27\" or lower seat height. Note that some bikes have wider \"waists\" that require you to spread your legs farther apart, so visit a dealer and sit on a variety of bikes until you find ones that you can sit comfortable atop with both feet planted.\n\n- Center of gravity: Bikes weigh from 250 lbs (dirt bikes) to over 800 lbs (large \"dresser\" cruiser bikes). Most bikes weigh between 400 and 600 lbs. However, weight isn't what makes a bike tip over easily -- rather, it's where the center of gravity is located. Sport bikes and adventure bikes carry their weight higher and more forward in the frame, where as standard and cruiser bikes carry it lower and closer to the rider. If you, as a new rider, grab a fistful of front brake during a low speed maneuver, what is going to cause the bike to start tipping over faster? Having a heavy weight high and forward. When assessing a first bike, look at where the engine and transmission mass seems to be centered relative to rider position. Sit on the bike with both feet planted and tilt it a little to the left and the right. Do you feel more or less strain on your shoulders as you bring it back it back to center? If you feel more, that sensation will become a danger when your learning low speed maneuvers and require more physical compensation, and will inhibit your ability to develop a good low speed riding technique.\n\n- Ergonomics: Most people feel cool in a racer's lean on a supersport, or slung back in a feet-forward posture when riding a cruiser. However, starting in those positions as a new rider can lead to discomfort, or inhibit your ability to develop solid basic riding techniques. Ideally, you want to be upright, elbows loose and bent and even with the bars. Your back should be straight with about a 5 degree forward lean. Your feet should be below your hips with a comfortable bend to the knees. In this position, you have the flexibility to better compensate for a lack of experience and technique when you encounter challenging situations on the road.\n\n- Engine displacement: Much ado is made about choosing the right displacement for a start bike. This is a bit of a myth: very few bikes, regardless of displacement, are fundamentally hostile to a new rider when it comes to engine performance: they are as fast or as slow as you treat the throttle. That said, smaller displacement bikes tend to be lighter, have lower seats, and are generally more newbie-friendly. However, some larger displacement bikes, including 650-900cc standards and 1100cc-plus cruisers can also be safe to learn on, as they favor low-revving torque over high-revving horsepower, with relatively gentle throttle response but plenty of grunt to push you forward from idle without extensive clutch feathering and rev management. Conversely, some smaller bikes, like the Kawasaki Ninja 250, require extensive revving and frequent gear shifting to get to street and highway speeds. Ask yourself: Do I want a light bike that will force me to learn good gear and rev management (a good idea if you have track aspirations), or a heavier bike that starts moving right off idle and requires less gear changing at street speeds? That's your answer to the question of displacement.\n\n- Throttle and brake response. Modern fuel injection, ECU development, and environmental emissions regulations have led to a situation where many sportier bikes have notchy throttles at low speeds, where closing the throttle cuts fuel and causes the bike to lurch a bit. This can be unpleasant for new riders who have yet to learn partial clutch management skills. Additionally, powerful sport bikes with inline-4 or V4 engine configuration can stutter and lurch at very low revs, requiring careful clutch and rev management that might be unfamiliar or uncomfortable to new riders -- these are bikes designed to be ridden fast, high in their powerbands. Additionally, powerful supersports and \"hooligan\" supermotos have very powerful brakes, like Brembo's Stylema or M4 units, which can easily pitch a new rider over the bars if they haven't developed a light, progressive touch on the brakes. If you, as a new rider, are having to spend your riding time compensating for unpredictable throttle behaviors or aggressive brakes, you aren't in a place to quickly learn good techniques safely.\n\nSo with all that in mind, what are some good starter bikes?\n\n- Kawasaki Ninja 400 or Z400: If your ambition is to ride a powerful supersport (like Kawasaki's own ZX-10R), start with a Ninja 400 or Z400. The Ninja is similar in style to supersport bikes, but has raised \"clip-on\" handle bars that convey the appearance of a racer but raise the incline of your posture to a more comfortable space. They also have a slightly lower seat height, and an accommodating 399cc parallel-twin motor with good throttle response and solid but unthreatening brakes. The Z400 is a more upright version of the Ninja 400 that shares the same engine and brakes, but lacks the plastic fairing and clip-on grips. Similar bikes include Yamaha's 321cc R3 and MT-03, Honda's CBR500F and CBR500R, KTM's RC390 and Duke 390, and BMW's G310. All of them perform very similarly, and are considered great gateway bikes to sport riding. Many track enthusiasts favor these bikes due to their light weight, engaging engines, and overall low cost of maintenance and insurance. If you really feel the need for speed so early in your riding career, Yamaha's MT-07 and Triumph's Trident 660 are relatively safe choices.\n\n- Triumph Street Twin 900. While well over 400 lbs, Triumph's Street Twin 900 is a very newbie friendly bike with a smooth, slow revving 900cc parallel-twin engine that puts down a lot of grunt and requires very little rev management -- you can short shift it any gear and still have the torque to move away cleanly without any fuss. Its comfortable seat and neutral \"standard\" riding position, along with its traction control and ABS features, mean that riding it is effortless and you won't be sore when you step off it after a long day cruising the backroads. It carries its weight low and close to the rider, and has a low-ish seat height of approximately 30\". Brakes are progressive without being intimidating, and a new rider will quickly learn good technique astride it. It also looks the part of a modern retro motorcycle, with clean curb appeal. Similar bikes include Moto Guzzi's V7 series, Kawasaki's Z650RS, and Royal Enfield's 650cc Interceptor.\n\n- Honda's Rebel 500. While it may not be the most eye-catching cruiser at the local Starbucks, Honda's Rebel 500 is a great gateway to the cruiser world. The 500cc engine is tuned for torque, not speed, and its low seat height of around 26\" means it is approachable by riders of all heights. It can keep up with larger bikes and serves as an effective commuter, with low costs of insurance and maintenance, and can be easily customized. Similar bikes include Royal Enfield's 350 Meteor and 650 Super Meteor, and Honda's 600cc Shadow line. For those not intimidated by weight, Harley-Davidson's 1700cc Heritage Softail is a surprisingly accommodating bike for new riders, with a low seat height and an impressive center of gravity that makes the bike feel a couple hundred pounds lighter once bumped off its kickstand. Avoid the older Sportster line, often inappropriately pitched as \"the Harley for new riders\" due to their relatively low displacements compared to KD's more upmarket models -- these bikes have very high-and-forward centers of gravity and weak front brakes that can easily inhibit your skills development.\n\nLastly, if you're looking at adventure bikes, Royal Enfield's 400cc Himalayan, Kawasaki's Versys 300X, and BMW's G310GS provide light weights, friendly engines, and reasonable seat heights all while being moderately well-equipped for gravel or graded dirt roads.\n\nThe most important thing, however, is to take the time to sit on the bikes at a dealer and think hard about the qualities discussed in this article. If you fall in love with the hobby, the bike you get today will not be the bike you have tomorrow. Focus on learning, not fashion, and make a choice that feels comfortable and safe to you."}]}

His name is George and my name is Steve. I live alone in Unit 2C and I work long hours. Include details regarding my rental contract that currently only permits dogs under 25 pounds and caged animals and requires pet deposit and rent. Give him examples as to why those animals are not ideal (include my dog allergy) and why a cat is better. Let him know I plan a robotic vacuum and mop to keep things clean. Tell him I've already found a potential pet at the local animal shelter, who is a two-year-old shelter cat who is housebroken and friendly. Remind him that Unit 2C does not have any carpeted floors and a tiled bathroom which is good for the future litter box. Convince him I'm open to a conversation to discuss further.\n\n### Response:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Hello, George,\n\nThis is Steve in Unit 2C. I hope your day is going well. I have a request I would like to ask of you.\n\nAs you know, I live alone. I have been considering getting a pet for companionship, but after reviewing my rental contract, I noticed the only permitted animals are small dogs and animals that can be kept in a tank, like hamsters and fish.\n\nI am hoping you would reconsider these restrictions and allow me to have a cat. I am more than willing to resign a rental contract to include the requisite pet deposit and pet rent.\n\nI thought about a dog, since those animals are already in the contract, but I don't want a dog. Since I work long hours, it's not ideal to have a dog in my unit. My unit is small and could be claustrophobic for a dog who has a lot of energy. I also don't want to leave a dog alone because it may bark and disturb the other tenants in the building. Dogs also urinate and defecate in the shared yard around the property, which is gross, considering not everyone picks up after their dogs. Also, I am allergic to dogs, so this rules out dogs.\n\nI also considered a hamster or fish, but I am reluctant to have either of those, as well. Firstly, they do not offer the same cuddly companionship of a cat. If a hamster got loose, it could cause far more damage to a unit than a cat could -- the hamster could defecate in many areas, chew electrical wires, and chew through drywall. Fish pose a problem if the tank cracks or breaks, which would cause lots of water damage to the flooring.\n\nI recognize there are drawbacks to any pet, including cats, and I understand that some landlords are reluctant to permit cats, because there is an impression that cats may be more destructive, such as peeing in inappropriate places. However, I believe a cat is the least-destructive option of all. As my unit is not carpeted, I don't believe persistent urination stains will be an issue. Cats are easy to litter box train and I plan to put the litter box in the tiled bathroom where there is no opportunity for urine to get into the subfloor. Cats are less destructive than dogs, because they don't chew on things like furniture and doorways. Cats also are not nearly as loud as barking dogs. \n\nI have already looked into pets at the local animal shelter and found a possible new roommate, who is a friendly two-year-old cat and is housebroken and box-trained. This is an ideal pet, since I don't have to risk accidents with box-training a kitten, and it's unlikely the cat will be destructive if it's already housebroken.\n\nI believe a cat would be the ideal companion for me, given my work schedule and my preference for my ideal pet. I am happy to discuss my desire in person and further elaborate my plan on how I will continue to maintain a clean and tidy unit with a cat, such as purchasing an automatic robot vacuum and mop to ensure an extra clean space.\n\nPlease consider my request. I look forward to your response. \n\nSincerely,\nSteve"}]}

It was created to serve as an alternative to ham and egg late-night dinners.\n\nIngredients\nThe Hot Brown is an open-faced sandwich of turkey breast and ham and bacon, covered in creamy Mornay sauce and baked or broiled until the bread is crisp and the sauce begins to brown. Cheddar cheese or American cheese may be added for the sauce. Alternatives for garnishes include tomatoes, mushroom slices, and, very rarely, canned peaches.\n\nSome Hot Browns also include ham with the turkey, and either pimentos or tomatoes over the sauce, and imitation Hot Browns sometimes substitute a commercial cheese sauce instead of the Mornay.\n\nWhen Fred K. Schmidt created the Hot Brown, its sliced roast turkey was a rarity, as turkey was usually reserved for holiday feasts. The original Hot Brown included the sliced turkey on an open-faced white toast sandwich, with Mornay sauce covering it, with a sprinkling of Parmesan cheese, completed by being oven-broiled until bubbly. Pimento and bacon strips were then added to it. After its debut, it quickly became the choice of 95% of the Brown Hotel's restaurant customers.\n\nThe dish is a local specialty and favorite of the Louisville area, and is popular throughout Kentucky. It was long unavailable at its point of origin, as the Brown Hotel was shuttered from 1971 to 1985.\n\nAnswer:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "The Hot Brown is an open faced sandwich that is a local speciality throughout Kentucky.

To initiate auto-rotation, the helicopter pilot flattens the pitch in the rotor system's blades, reducing drag, and allowing the upward flow of air to drive its rotation.  When the helicopter is 100-150 feet above the ground, the pilot will then aggressively increase the pitch of the rotor system's blades, temporarily increasing lift and cushioning the helicopter's landing."}]}

This might be due to maintenance activities with employees working on a section of the power grid, or to prevent issues in inclimate weather, such as preventing wildfire ignition in high-wind events. \n- Weather-caused issues: high wind or ice-storms can sometimes snap power lines or cause tree limbs to fall. \n\nCheck with your utility provider to stay up to date on any outage you are experiencing.

Nuclear fission is a very cool concept that gives us nuclear energy to power our homes and cities! You know how everything around us is made of little components called atoms, right? The centers of these atoms, called the nuclei, are themselves made of particles, called protons and neutrons. These particles are super tiny, hundreds of times smaller than the atoms themselves! Anyway, the particles in the nucleus are stuck firmly together, but if disturbed by a high-energy particle, the nucleus can split apart. When it does that, it releases a lot of energy as light and heat. This splitting of the nucleus is called fission.\n\nIn some materials, each nucleus that splits also releases more loose particles, typically neutrons, that can hit other atoms, and this leads to what's called a chain reaction: one atom splitting can cause others to do so, and keep releasing more energy. If left uncontrolled in a dense enough material, this leads to an atomic explosion, which is very bad. Definitely don't try that at home! In fact don't try anything else at home. But if controlled with the right amount of moderating material, this type of reaction can give rise to a continuous and cheap source of energy, as used in nuclear power plants. Some countries get most of their energy today from nuclear fission.\n\nThe craziest thing about nuclear fission is that it was only discovered and put into use starting in the 1930s. It's such a new finding, and it's totally changed the world. Science rules!"}]}

However, neither where coffee was first cultivated nor direct evidence of its consumption prior to the 15th century have been found. Sufi monasteries in Yemen employed coffee as an aid to concentration during prayers. Coffee later spread to the Levant and Persia in the early 16th century; it caused some controversy on whether it was halal in Ottoman and Mamluk society. Coffee arrived in Italy the second half of the 16th century through commercial Mediterranean trade routes, while Central and Eastern Europeans learnt of coffee from the Ottomans. By the mid 17th century, it had reached India and the East Indies.\n\nCoffee houses would establish themselves in Western Europe by the late 17th century, especially in England and Germany. One of the earliest cultivations of coffee in the New World was when Gabriel de Clieu brought coffee seedlings to Martinique in 1720. These beans later sprouted 18,680 coffee trees which enabled its spread to other Caribbean islands like Saint-Domingue and also to Mexico. By 1788, Saint-Domingue supplied half the world's coffee.\n\nBy 1852, globally, Brazil became the largest producer of coffee and has held that status ever since. The period since 1950 saw the widening of the playing field due to the emergence of several other major producers, notably Colombia, Ivory Coast, Ethiopia, and Vietnam; the latter overtook Colombia and became the second-largest producer in 1999. Modern production techniques along with the mass productization of coffee has made it a household item today.\n"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "* Oral tradition has coffee drinking originating in modern day Ethiopia\n* Sufi monasteries in Yemen used coffee to aid prayers in the 15th century\n* Spread to the Levant and Persia in the 16th century\n* Arrived in Italy in the second half of the 16th century via Ottoman empire\n* By mid-17th century had arrived in India and the East Indies\n* Established in Western Europe by the late 17th century, especially in England and Germany\n* First cultivated in Martinique in the New World in 1720 and spread to Sanit-Domingue and Mexico\n* By 1852 Brazil had become the world's largest coffee producer\n* Since 1950 the major growers have been Colombia, Ivory Coast, Ethiopia, and Vietnam"}]}

In the first book, Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone, Harry lives in a cupboard under the stairs in the house of the Dursleys, his aunt, uncle and cousin, Dudley. The Dursleys consider themselves perfectly normal, but at the age of 11, Harry discovers that he is a wizard. He meets a half-giant named Hagrid who invites him to attend the Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry. Harry learns that as a baby, his parents were murdered by the dark wizard Lord Voldemort. When Voldemort attempted to kill Harry, his curse rebounded and Harry survived with a lightning-shaped scar on his forehead.\nHarry becomes a student at Hogwarts and is sorted into Gryffindor House. He gains the friendship of Ron Weasley, a member of a large but poor wizarding family, and Hermione Granger, a witch of non-magical, or Muggle, parentage. Harry encounters the school's potions master, Severus Snape, who displays a dislike for him; the rich pure-blood Draco Malfoy whom he develops an enmity with; and the Defence Against the Dark Arts teacher, Quirinus Quirrell, who turns out to be allied with Lord Voldemort.

Here are some steps to follow to help you swim in the ocean:\n\nChoose a Safe Location: Before entering the water, make sure you choose a safe location to swim. Look for a spot that's away from strong currents, riptides, and waves. Avoid swimming alone, and make sure there are other people around in case you need help.\n\nCheck the Conditions: Before entering the water, check the weather and ocean conditions. Avoid swimming if there are strong winds, high waves, or thunderstorms. If there are lifeguards on duty, ask them about the current conditions and any potential hazards.\n\nWear Proper Gear: Make sure you wear proper swimwear, such as a wetsuit or rash guard, to protect your skin from the sun and ocean elements. Consider wearing fins or a snorkel to help you swim more efficiently.\n\nPractice Good Swimming Technique: When swimming in the ocean, use good swimming technique to help conserve your energy. Avoid swimming against the current, and swim parallel to the shore if you need to move sideways. Use a slow, steady stroke to conserve energy.\n\nBe Aware of Marine Life: When swimming in the ocean, be aware of any marine life that may be in the water. Avoid swimming near schools of fish, and stay away from jellyfish and other potentially dangerous creatures. If you do encounter a shark or other predator, stay calm and swim away slowly.\n\nFollow Ocean Safety Rules: Finally, follow any ocean safety rules that are in place. For example, some beaches may have specific areas designated for swimming, while others may require you to wear a life jacket or avoid swimming during certain times of day.\n\nBy following these steps, you can enjoy a safe and enjoyable swimming experience in the ocean. Remember to stay aware of your surroundings, practice good swimming technique, and take proper safety precautions to ensure that you stay safe."}]}

The band consists of Thom Yorke (vocals, guitar, piano, keyboards); brothers Jonny Greenwood (lead guitar, keyboards, other instruments) and Colin Greenwood (bass); Ed O'Brien (guitar, backing vocals); and Philip Selway (drums, percussion). They have worked with the producer Nigel Godrich and the cover artist Stanley Donwood since 1994. Radiohead's experimental approach is credited with advancing the sound of alternative rock.\n\nRadiohead signed to EMI in 1991 and released their debut album, Pablo Honey, in 1993. Their debut single, \"Creep\", became a worldwide hit. Radiohead's popularity and critical standing rose with the release of The Bends in 1995. Radiohead's third album, OK Computer (1997), brought them international fame; noted for its complex production and themes of modern alienation, it is acclaimed as a landmark record and one of the best albums in popular music.\n\nRadiohead's fourth album, Kid A (2000), marked a dramatic change in style, incorporating influences from electronic music, jazz, classical music and krautrock. Though Kid A divided listeners, it was later named the best album of the decade by multiple outlets. It was followed by Amnesiac (2001), recorded in the same sessions. Hail to the Thief (2003), with lyrics addressing the War on Terror, blended the band's rock and electronic sides, and was Radiohead's final album for EMI.\n\nRadiohead self-released their seventh album, In Rainbows (2007), as a download for which customers could set their own price, to critical and chart success. Their eighth album, The King of Limbs (2011), an exploration of rhythm, was developed using extensive looping and sampling. A Moon Shaped Pool (2016) prominently featured Jonny Greenwood's orchestral arrangements. Yorke, Jonny Greenwood, Selway, and O'Brien have released solo albums; in 2021, Yorke and Jonny Greenwood debuted a new band, the Smile.\n\nBy 2011, Radiohead had sold more than 30 million albums worldwide. Their awards include six Grammy Awards and four Ivor Novello Awards, and they hold five Mercury Prize nominations, the most of any act. Seven Radiohead singles have reached the top 10 on the UK Singles Chart: \"Creep\" (1992), \"Street Spirit (Fade Out)\" (1996), \"Paranoid Android\" (1997), \"Karma Police\" (1997), \"No Surprises\" (1998), \"Pyramid Song\" (2001), and \"There There\" (2003). \"Creep\" and \"Nude\" (2008) reached the top 40 on the US Billboard Hot 100. Rolling Stone named Radiohead one of the 100 greatest artists of all time, and Rolling Stone readers voted them the second-best artist of the 2000s. Five Radiohead albums have been included in Rolling Stone's 500 Greatest Albums of All Time lists. Radiohead were inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 2019.\nOutput:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Pablo Honey  - 1993; The Bends - 1995; OK Computer - 1997; Kid A - 2000; Amnesiac - 2001; Hail to the Thief - 2003; In Rainbows - 2007; The King of Limbs - 2011; A Moon Shaped Pool - 2016"}]}

After his grand slam in 1930, Jones acquired the former plant nursery and co-designed Augusta National with course architect Alister MacKenzie. First played 89 years ago in 1934, the tournament is an official money event on the PGA Tour, the European Tour, and the Japan Golf Tour. The field of players is smaller than those of the other major championships because it is an invitational event, held by the Augusta National Golf Club.\n\nThe tournament has a number of traditions. Since 1949, a green jacket has been awarded to the champion, who must return it to the clubhouse one year after his victory, although it remains his personal property and is stored with other champions' jackets in a specially designated cloakroom. In most instances, only a first-time and currently reigning champion may remove his jacket from the club grounds. A golfer who wins the event multiple times uses the same green jacket awarded upon his initial win (unless they need to be re-fitted with a new jacket). The Champions Dinner, inaugurated by Ben Hogan in 1952, is held on the Tuesday before each tournament, and is open only to past champions and certain board members of the Augusta National Golf Club. Beginning in 1963, legendary golfers, usually past champions, have hit an honorary tee shot on the morning of the first round to commence play. These have included Fred McLeod, Jock Hutchinson, Gene Sarazen, Sam Snead, Byron Nelson, Arnold Palmer, Jack Nicklaus, Gary Player, Lee Elder, and Tom Watson. Since 1960, a semi-social contest at the par-3 course has been played on Wednesday, the day before the first round.\n\nNicklaus has the most Masters wins, with six between 1963 and 1986. Tiger Woods won five between 1997 and 2019. Palmer won four between 1958 and 1964. Five have won three titles at Augusta: Jimmy Demaret, Sam Snead, Gary Player, Nick Faldo, and Phil Mickelson. Player, from South Africa, was the first non-American player to win the tournament, in 1961; the second was Seve Ballesteros of Spain, the champion in 1980 and 1983.\n\nThe Augusta National course first opened 90 years ago in 1933 and has been modified many times by different architects. Among the changes: greens have been reshaped and, on occasion, entirely re-designed, bunkers have been added, water hazards have been extended, new tee boxes have been built, hundreds of trees have been planted, and several mounds have been installed."}]}

Upon joining the Football League in 1893, the club returned to the Manor Ground and installed stands and terracing, upgrading it from just a field. Arsenal continued to play their home games there for the next twenty years (with two exceptions in the 1894\u201395 season), until the move to north London in 1913.\n\nWidely referred to as Highbury, Arsenal Stadium was the club's home from September 1913 until May 2006. The original stadium was designed by the renowned football architect Archibald Leitch, and had a design common to many football grounds in the UK at the time, with a single covered stand and three open-air banks of terracing. The entire stadium was given a massive overhaul in the 1930s: new Art Deco West and East stands were constructed, opening in 1932 and 1936 respectively, and a roof was added to the North Bank terrace, which was bombed during the Second World War and not restored until 1954.\n\nHighbury could hold more than 60,000 spectators at its peak, and had a capacity of 57,000 until the early 1990s. The Taylor Report and Premier League regulations obliged Arsenal to convert Highbury to an all-seater stadium in time for the 1993\u201394 season, thus reducing the capacity to 38,419 seated spectators. This capacity had to be reduced further during Champions League matches to accommodate additional advertising boards, so much so that for two seasons, from 1998 to 2000, Arsenal played Champions League home matches at Wembley, which could house more than 70,000 spectators.\n\n\nExpansion of Highbury was restricted because the East Stand had been designated as a Grade II listed building and the other three stands were close to residential properties. These limitations prevented the club from maximising matchday revenue during the 1990s and first decade of the 21st century, putting them in danger of being left behind in the football boom of that time. After considering various options, in 2000 Arsenal proposed building a new 60,361-capacity stadium at Ashburton Grove, since named the Emirates Stadium, about 500 metres south-west of Highbury. The project was initially delayed by red tape and rising costs, and construction was completed in July 2006, in time for the start of the 2006\u201307 season. The stadium was named after its sponsors, the airline company Emirates, with whom the club signed the largest sponsorship deal in English football history, worth around \u00a3100 million. Some fans referred to the ground as Ashburton Grove, or the Grove, as they did not agree with corporate sponsorship of stadium names. The stadium will be officially known as Emirates Stadium until at least 2028, and the airline will be the club's shirt sponsor until at least 2024. From the start of the 2010\u201311 season on, the stands of the stadium have been officially known as North Bank, East Stand, West Stand and Clock end. The capacity of the Emirates now stands at 60,704.\n\nResponse:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\n  \"Stadiums\": [\n    {\n      \"name\": \"Plumstead Common\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"name\": \"Manor Ground\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"name\": \"Invicta Ground\",\n      \"year\": \"1890\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"name\": \"Manor Ground\",\n      \"year\": \"1893\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"name\": \"Arsenal Stadium\",\n      \"year\": \"1913\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"name\": \"Emirates Stadium\",\n      \"year\": \"2006\"\n    }\n  ]\n}"}]}

This redesigned Outback keeps the same body style (wagon/crossover SUV), while still receiving a few changes, such as new taillights (similar to the ones on the Forester and upcoming Legacy) and an updated, modern interior.\n\nInternally, the 2020 Outback moves to the Subaru Global Platform, which is stiffer and offers a common base to allow use of alternative powertrains, such as hybrid or all-electric. The base model sixth-generation Outback was offered with the 2.5-liter gasoline direct-injection FB25D; a turbocharged 2.4-liter FA24F that was first used on the Subaru Ascent was offered as the uplevel engine, providing improved power, torque, and consumption compared to the discontinued EZ36.\n\nIn addition to all-wheel drive coming standard on every trim, the 2021 model year also added LED adaptive steering-responsive headlights (SRH) on premium variants and a seat-belt reminder standard for all passengers.\n\nWorld markets outside of North America, including Japan, did not launch the sixth generation Outback until 2021.\n\nAustralia launched on the 20th February 2021 with a number of differences over the North American version including updated LED headlights with combined Day Running Light and turn/direction indicator with SRH (Steering Responsive Headlights) standard across all variants (the Touring model also gained Adaptive Driving Beam (ADB) until 2023 when ADB became standard across all model variants), as is pushbutton-start with tailgate PIN access. There is improved camera resolution for rear, side and front driver assistance cameras, EyeSight 4.0 with roadside speed sign reading, adjustable speed limiting, and intersection crash avoidance utilising new EyeSight cameras with a wider field of view and a lower profile inside the cabin. Subaru claim the sole engine fitted to Australian Outbacks, the revised 2.5-litre FB25D, is made of 90% new components compared to the Gen5 engine as well. The Japanese Outback was announced on October 7, 2021; in Japan the Outback is offered exclusively with the 1.8-litre CB18 gasoline direct-injection turbo engine instead.\n\nIn September 2021, the European variant received a five-star rating by the European New Car Assessment Programme (EuroNCAP) 2021.\n\nFor the 2022 model year, Subaru added a new trim level, the Wilderness. Outback Wilderness features 9.5 inches of ground clearance, turbocharged 2.4-liter FA24F engine, and re-tuned transmission gearing with revised front and rear gear ratios. Marketed for off-road use, the Outback Wilderness has 17\" wheels with standard all-terrain tires, enhanced body cladding, and synthetic upholstery.\nOutput:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "2022"}]}

Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\n\n### Instruction:\nWhy did Ken Shamrock change his last name?\n\n### Input:\nKenneth Wayne Shamrock (n\u00e9 Kilpatrick; born February 11, 1964) is an American bare-knuckle boxing promoter and semi-retired professional wrestler, mixed martial artist, and kickboxer. He is best known for his time in Ultimate Fighting Championship (UFC) and other combat sports. A member of the UFC Hall of Fame, Shamrock is widely regarded as an icon and pioneer of the sport. He has headlined over 15 main events and co-main events in the UFC and Pride FC and set numerous MMA pay-per-view records. In the early part of his UFC career, Shamrock was named \"The World's Most Dangerous Man\" by ABC News in a special called \"The World's Most Dangerous Things\". The moniker has stuck as his nickname.\n\nShamrock became known early on in the UFC for his rivalry with Royce Gracie. After fighting to a draw in the inaugural UFC \"Superfight\", he became the first UFC Superfight Champion when he defeated Dan Severn at UFC 6; the title was eventually replaced by the UFC Heavyweight Championship when weight categories were introduced to the UFC. He was also the first foreign MMA champion in Japan, winning the title of King of Pancrase Openweight title. During his reign as the UFC Superfight Champion, he was widely considered the #1 mixed martial artist in the world, and in 2008, Shamrock was ranked by Inside MMA as one of the top 10 greatest mixed martial arts fighters of all time. He is the founder of the Lion's Den mixed martial arts training camp, and is the older brother of fellow fighter Frank Shamrock.\n\nIn addition to his mixed martial arts career, Shamrock enjoyed considerable success in professional wrestling, particularly during his tenure with the World Wrestling Federation (WWF, now WWE). There, he is a one-time Intercontinental Champion, a one-time World Tag Team Champion and the 1998 King of the Ring. Shamrock also wrestled for Total Nonstop Action Wrestling (TNA, now Impact Wrestling), where he is a one-time NWA World Heavyweight Champion \u2013 the first world champion under the TNA banner \u2013 and a 2020 inductee in the Impact Hall of Fame. He headlined multiple pay-per-view events in both promotions, including 1997's D-Generation X: In Your House, where he challenged for the WWF Championship. Additionally, Shamrock was also one of the first wrestlers to use the shoot style of wrestling in America, being credited by WWE with popularizing the legitimate ankle lock submission hold.\n\nA \"military brat,\" Kilpatrick was born at Robins Air Force Base, in Warner Robins, Georgia, where he lived for his first four years. His father Richard Kilpatrick was a United States Air Force enlistee, and his mother Diane Kilpatrick was a waitress and dancer who had her first son when she was 15. Shamrock had three brothers and came from a broken family in a predominantly black neighborhood of Atlanta, Georgia.\n\nHe was often left to fend for himself, and, without his parents' supervision or guidance, got into many fights. His father abandoned his family when Shamrock was five. His mother married an Army aviator named Bob Nance, and the newly formed family moved to Napa, California, Nance's hometown. Shamrock and his brothers were outsiders in this community, coming from a poor background and speaking in a Southern accent. They continued to cause trouble and get into fights and began using drugs. Nance, who fought in the Vietnam War, joined the local fire department and also worked in roofing and upholstery. Shamrock became involved in and excelled at sports at a young age, playing in Little League baseball and Pop Warner football. Nance remembers a veteran coach telling him that he had never seen a player with as much heart and tenacity as the young Shamrock. Shamrock was not as involved with drugs as his brothers, such as his brother Richie, who enjoyed smoking marijuana and eventually using heroin intravenously, but who also played football.\n\nAt age 10, Shamrock ran away from home for the first time, and was stabbed by another child on the run, ending up in the hospital. When he was 13, his stepfather kicked him out of their home, and each of the brothers went their own ways. Shamrock lived in cars before being placed in a foster home. He went through seven group homes and served time in a juvenile hall. He moved between several more group homes before being placed in Bob Shamrock's Boys' Home at age 14 in Susanville, California where he turned his life around. Bob Shamrock legally adopted Ken as his son, and Ken changed his last name from Kilpatrick to Shamrock in Bob's honor.\n\nAt Lassen High School, Shamrock (known there as Kenny Nance) excelled in football and wrestling. As a senior, he qualified for the state championships in wrestling, but broke his neck in practice days before the competition and underwent neck surgery. He received no scholarship offers from any big colleges, and doctors told him his sports career was likely over. Against doctors' orders, he joined the Shasta College football team, where he was voted team captain in his final season. The San Diego Chargers of the National Football League later offered him a tryout, but he declined in order to pursue a career in professional wrestling, where he debuted in 1989 in the South Atlantic Pro Wrestling promotion.\n\n### Response:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Ken Shamrock changed his last name from Kilpatrick to Shamrock in honor of his adoptive father, Bob Shamrock.

Alan Turing proved in 1936 that a general algorithm to solve the halting problem for all possible program\u2013input pairs cannot exist. For any program f that might determine whether programs halt, a \"pathological\" program g, called with some input, can pass its own source and its input to f and then specifically do the opposite of what f predicts g will do. No f can exist that handles this case. A key part of the proof is a mathematical definition of a computer and program, which is known as a Turing machine; the halting problem is undecidable over Turing machines. It is one of the first cases of decision problems proven to be unsolvable.

The guitarist and vocalist David Gilmour joined in January 1968; Barrett left in April 1968 due to deteriorating mental health. Waters became the primary lyricist and thematic leader, devising the concepts behind Pink Floyd's most successful albums, The Dark Side of the Moon (1973), Wish You Were Here (1975), Animals (1977) and The Wall (1979).

Pink Floyd also composed several film scores.\n\nFollowing personal tensions, Wright left Pink Floyd in 1981, followed by Waters in 1985. Gilmour and Mason continued as Pink Floyd, rejoined later by Wright. They produced the albums A Momentary Lapse of Reason (1987) and The Division Bell (1994), backed by major tours, before entering a long hiatus. In 2005, all but Barrett reunited for a performance at the global awareness event Live 8. Barrett died in 2006, and Wright in 2008. The last Pink Floyd studio album, The Endless River (2014), was based on unreleased material from the Division Bell recording sessions. In 2022, Gilmour and Mason reformed Pink Floyd to release the song \"Hey, Hey, Rise Up!\" in protest of the Russo-Ukrainian War.\n\nBy 2013, Pink Floyd had sold more than 250 million records worldwide, making them one of the best-selling music artists of all time. The Dark Side of the Moon and The Wall were inducted into the Grammy Hall of Fame, and these albums and Wish You Were Here are among the best-selling albums of all time. Four Pink Floyd albums topped the US Billboard 200, and five topped the UK Albums Chart. Pink Floyd's hit singles include \"See Emily Play\" (1967), \"Money\" (1973), \"Another Brick in the Wall, Part 2\" (1979), \"Not Now John\" (1983), \"On the Turning Away\" (1987) and \"High Hopes\" (1994). They were inducted into the US Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1996 and the UK Music Hall of Fame in 2005. In 2008, Pink Floyd were awarded the Polar Music Prize in Sweden for their contribution to modern music.\n\nAnswer:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "- The Piper at the Gates of Dawn,1967\n- The Dark Side of the Moon,1973\n- Wish You Were Here,1975\n- Animals,1977\n- The Wall,1979\n- A Momentary Lapse of Reason,1987\n- The Division Bell,1994\n- The Endless River,2014"}]}

Wimbledon is the only major still played on grass, the traditional tennis playing surface. Also, it is the only Grand Slam that retains a night-time curfew, though matches can now continue until 11.00 pm under the lights.\n\nThe tournament traditionally takes place over two weeks in late June and early July, starting on the last Monday in June and culminating with the Ladies' and Gentlemen's Singles Finals, scheduled for the Saturday and Sunday at the end of the second week. Five major events are held each year, with additional junior and invitational competitions also taking place. In 2009, Wimbledon's Centre Court was fitted with a retractable roof to lessen the loss of playing time due to rain. A roof was operational over No. 1 Court from 2019, when a number of other improvements were made, including adding cushioned seating, a table and 10 independently operable cameras per court to capture the games.\n\nWimbledon traditions include a strict all-white dress code for competitors, and royal patronage. Strawberries and cream are traditionally consumed at the tournament. Unlike other tournaments, advertising is minimal and low key from official suppliers such as Slazenger and Rolex. The relationship with Slazenger is the world's longest-running sporting sponsorship, providing balls for the tournament since 1902.\n\nDue to the COVID-19 pandemic, 2020 Wimbledon was cancelled, the first cancellation of the tournament since World War II. The rescheduled 134th edition was staged from 28 June 2021 to 11 July 2021, following from the 2020 cancellation. The 135th edition was played between 27 June 2022 and 10 July 2022, and regularly scheduled play occurred on the middle Sunday for the first time. It marks the centenary of the inaugural championships staged at the Centre Court. The ATP, ITF, and WTA did not award ranking points for the 2022 tournament, due to controversy over the tournament excluding players representing Russia and Belarus.\n\nThe 2023 Wimbledon Championships will be the 136th staging and will run from 3 July 2023 to 16 July 2023 and it will be the first event of King Charles III since the death of the former patron, Queen Elizabeth II on 8 September 2022."}]}

One process is called thermal oxidation, which forms silicon dioxide on the surface of the silicon. This is used as a gate insulator and field oxide. Other processes are called photomasks and photolithography. This process is what creates the patterns on the circuit in the integrated circuit. Ultraviolet light is used along with a photoresist layer to create a chemical change that generates the patterns for the circuit.\n\nThe etching is the next process that is required. The part of the silicon that was not covered by the photoresist layer from the previous step can now be etched. The main process typically used today is called plasma etching. Plasma etching usually involves an etch gas pumped in a low-pressure chamber to create plasma. A common etch gas is chlorofluorocarbon, or more commonly known Freon. A high radio-frequency voltage between the cathode and anode is what creates the plasma in the chamber. The silicon wafer is located on the cathode, which causes it to be hit by the positively charged ions that are released from the plasma. The result is silicon that is etched anisotropically.\n\nThe last process is called diffusion. This is the process that gives the semiconducting material its desired semiconducting properties. It is also known as doping. The process introduces an impure atom to the system, which creates the p\u2013n junction. To get the impure atoms embedded in the silicon wafer, the wafer is first put in a 1,100 degree Celsius chamber. The atoms are injected in and eventually diffuse with the silicon. After the process is completed and the silicon has reached room temperature, the doping process is done and the semiconducting material is ready to be used in an integrated circuit.\n\n"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "-Thermal oxidation\n-Photomasks/photolithography\n-Etching (mainly plasma etching)\n-Diffusion/doping"}]}

This marked the first major commercial release of sensor-based tracking, allowing for free movement of users within a defined space. A patent filed by Sony in 2017 showed they were developing a similar location tracking technology to the Vive for PlayStation VR, with the potential for the development of a wireless headset. In 2019, Oculus released the Oculus Rift S and a standalone headset, the Oculus Quest. These headsets utilized inside-out tracking compared to external outside-in tracking seen in previous generations of headsets. Later in 2019, Valve released the Valve Index. Notable features include a 130\u00b0 field of view, off-ear headphones for immersion and comfort, open-handed controllers which allow for individual finger tracking, front facing cameras, and a front expansion slot meant for extensibility.\n\nIn 2020, Oculus released the Oculus Quest 2. Some new features include a sharper screen, reduced price, and increased performance. Facebook (which became Meta a year later) initially required user to log in with a Facebook account in order to use the new headset. In 2021 the Oculus Quest 2 accounted for 80% of all VR headsets sold. Robinson R22 Virtual Reality Training Device developed by VRM Switzerland In 2021, EASA approved the first Virtual Reality based Flight Simulation Training Device. The device, for rotorcraft pilots, enhances safety by opening up the possibility of practicing risky maneuvers in a virtual environment. This addresses a key risk area in rotorcraft operations, where statistics show that around 20% of accidents occur during training flights.\n\nIn 2023, Sony released the Playstation VR2, a follow-up to their 2016 headset. Playstation VR2 comes with inside-out tracking, higher-resolution displays, controllers with adaptive triggers and haptic feedback, and a wider field-of-view.\nOutput:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "2016 - HTC Vive SteamVR - HTC\n2019 - Oculus Rift S - Oculus\n2019 - Oculus Quest - Oculus\n2019 - Valve Index - Valve\n2020 - Oculus Quest 2 - Oculus\n2021 - Robinson R22 Virtual Reality Training Device - VRM Switzerland\n2023 - Playstation VR2 - Sony"}]}

Ancient Egyptian texts dating from 2750 BCE referred to these fish as the \"Thunderer of the Nile\", and described them as the \"protectors\" of all other fish. Electric fish were again reported millennia later by ancient Greek, Roman and Arabic naturalists and physicians. Several ancient writers, such as Pliny the Elder and Scribonius Largus, attested to the numbing effect of electric shocks delivered by electric catfish and electric rays, and knew that such shocks could travel along conducting objects. Patients with ailments such as gout or headache were directed to touch electric fish in the hope that the powerful jolt might cure them.\nAncient cultures around the Mediterranean knew that certain objects, such as rods of amber, could be rubbed with cat's fur to attract light objects like feathers. Thales of Miletus made a series of observations on static electricity around 600 BCE, from which he believed that friction rendered amber magnetic, in contrast to minerals such as magnetite, which needed no rubbing.\nThales was incorrect in believing the attraction was due to a magnetic effect, but later science would prove a link between magnetism and electricity. According to a controversial theory, the Parthians may have had knowledge of electroplating, based on the 1936 discovery of the Baghdad Battery, which resembles a galvanic cell, though it is uncertain whether the artifact was electrical in nature.\nElectricity would remain little more than an intellectual curiosity for millennia until 1600, when the English scientist William Gilbert wrote De Magnete, in which he made a careful study of electricity and magnetism, distinguishing the lodestone effect from static electricity produced by rubbing amber. He coined the New Latin word electricus (\"of amber\" or \"like amber\",, elektron, the Greek word for \"amber\") to refer to the property of attracting small objects after being rubbed. This association gave rise to the English words \"electric\" and \"electricity\", which made their first appearance in print in Thomas Browne's Pseudodoxia Epidemica of 1646.\nFurther work was conducted in the 17th and early 18th centuries by Otto von Guericke, Robert Boyle, Stephen Gray and C. F. du Fay. Later in the 18th century, Benjamin Franklin conducted extensive research in electricity, selling his possessions to fund his work. In June 1752 he is reputed to have attached a metal key to the bottom of a dampened kite string and flown the kite in a storm-threatened sky. A succession of sparks jumping from the key to the back of his hand showed that lightning was indeed electrical in nature. He also explained the apparently paradoxical behavior of the Leyden jar as a device for storing large amounts of electrical charge in terms of electricity consisting of both positive and negative charges\nIn 1775, Hugh Williamson reported a series of experiments to the Royal Society on the shocks delivered by the electric eel; that same year the surgeon and anatomist John Hunter described the structure of the fish's electric organs. In 1791, Luigi Galvani published his discovery of bioelectromagnetics, demonstrating that electricity was the medium by which neurons passed signals to the muscles. Alessandro Volta's battery, or voltaic pile, of 1800, made from alternating layers of zinc and copper, provided scientists with a more reliable source of electrical energy than the electrostatic machines previously used. The recognition of electromagnetism, the unity of electric and magnetic phenomena, is due to Hans Christian \u00d8rsted and Andr\u00e9-Marie Amp\u00e8re in 1819\u20131820. Michael Faraday invented the electric motor in 1821, and Georg Ohm mathematically analysed the electrical circuit in 1827. Electricity and magnetism (and light) were definitively linked by James Clerk Maxwell, in particular in his \"On Physical Lines of Force\" in 1861 and 1862.\u200a\nWhile the early 19th century had seen rapid progress in electrical science, the late 19th century would see the greatest progress in electrical engineering. Through such people as Alexander Graham Bell, Ott\u00f3 Bl\u00e1thy, Thomas Edison, Galileo Ferraris, Oliver Heaviside, \u00c1nyos Jedlik, William Thomson, 1st Baron Kelvin, Charles Algernon Parsons, Werner von Siemens, Joseph Swan, Reginald Fessenden, Nikola Tesla and George Westinghouse, electricity turned from a scientific curiosity into an essential tool for modern life.\nIn 1887, Heinrich Hertz discovered that electrodes illuminated with ultraviolet light create electric sparks more easily. In 1905, Albert Einstein published a paper that explained experimental data from the photoelectric effect as being the result of light energy being carried in discrete quantized packets, energising electrons. This discovery led to the quantum revolution. Einstein was awarded the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1921 for \"his discovery of the law of the photoelectric effect\". The photoelectric effect is also employed in photocells such as can be found in solar panels.\nThe first solid-state device was the \"cat's-whisker detector\" first used in the 1900s in radio receivers. A whisker-like wire is placed lightly in contact with a solid crystal (such as a germanium crystal) to detect a radio signal by the contact junction effect. In a solid-state component, the current is confined to solid elements and compounds engineered specifically to switch and amplify it. Current flow can be understood in two forms: as negatively charged electrons, and as positively charged electron deficiencies called holes. These charges and holes are understood in terms of quantum physics. The building material is most often a crystalline semiconductor.\nSolid-state electronics came into its own with the emergence of transistor technology. The first working transistor, a germanium-based point-contact transistor, was invented by John Bardeen and Walter Houser Brattain at Bell Labs in 1947, followed by the bipolar junction transistor in 1948.\n\nResponse:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "While the early 19th century had seen rapid progress in electrical science, the late 19th century would see the greatest progress in electrical engineering.

Mitochondria have a double membrane structure and use aerobic respiration to generate adenosine triphosphate (ATP), which is used throughout the cell as a source of chemical energy. They were discovered by Albert von K\u00f6lliker in 1857  in the voluntary muscles of insects. The term mitochondrion was coined by Carl Benda in 1898. The mitochondrion is popularly nicknamed the \"powerhouse of the cell\", a phrase coined by Philip Siekevitz in a 1957 article of the same name.\n\nSome cells in some multicellular organisms lack mitochondria (for example, mature mammalian red blood cells). A large number of unicellular organisms, such as microsporidia, parabasalids and diplomonads, have reduced or transformed their mitochondria into other structures. One eukaryote, Monocercomonoides, is known to have completely lost its mitochondria, and one multicellular organism, Henneguya salminicola, is known to have retained mitochondrion-related organelles in association with a complete loss of their mitochondrial genome.\n\nMitochondria are commonly between 0.75 and 3 \u03bcm2 in cross section, but vary considerably in size and structure. Unless specifically stained, they are not visible. In addition to supplying cellular energy, mitochondria are involved in other tasks, such as signaling, cellular differentiation, and cell death, as well as maintaining control of the cell cycle and cell growth. Mitochondrial biogenesis is in turn temporally coordinated with these cellular processes. Mitochondria have been implicated in several human disorders and conditions, such as mitochondrial diseases, cardiac dysfunction, heart failure and autism.\n\nThe number of mitochondria in a cell can vary widely by organism, tissue, and cell type. A mature red blood cell has no mitochondria, whereas a liver cell can have more than 2000. The mitochondrion is composed of compartments that carry out specialized functions. These compartments or regions include the outer membrane, intermembrane space, inner membrane, cristae, and matrix.\n\nAlthough most of a eukaryotic cell's DNA is contained in the cell nucleus, the mitochondrion has its own genome (\"mitogenome\") that is substantially similar to bacterial genomes. This finding has led to general acceptance of the endosymbiotic hypothesis - that free-living prokaryotic ancestors of modern mitochondria permanently fused with eukaryotic cells in the distant past, evolving such that modern animals, plants, fungi, and other eukaryotes are able to respire to generate cellular energy."}]}

Absolute pitch means that a note is represented as an absolute frequency, so if someone says \"A2\", that pitch can be mapped back to an exact frequency, and therefore can be reconciled among many different styles of music and instrumentation. \n\nIn contrast, much of Indian music (both classical and non-classical) uses the concept of relative pitch, which means that the musician sets a tonic note (their base note) and that pitch is the starting point for all other notes. For example, if one musician were to say that a specific pitch were \"sa\" (one of the 7 notes in the Indian music scale), another musician would not be able to reproduce that note, since they wouldn't know where the first musician set their tonic. However, this has other advantages,  because a tune is defined in terms of relative pitch and can be reproduced easily among different musicians and instruments without the worry of an absolute frequency which cannot be reached by a specific musical range."}]}

That morning, nineteen terrorists hijacked four commercial airliners scheduled to travel from the East Coast to California. The hijackers crashed the first two planes into the Twin Towers of the World Trade Center in New York City and the third into the Pentagon (the headquarters of the United States military) in Arlington County, Virginia, near Washington, D.C. The fourth plane was similarly intended to hit a federal government building in D.C., but crashed in a field following a passenger revolt. The attacks killed nearly 3,000 people and instigated the global war on terror.\n\nThe first impact was that of American Airlines Flight 11. It was crashed into the North Tower of the World Trade Center complex in Lower Manhattan at 8:46 a.m. Seventeen minutes later, at 9:03, the World Trade Center's South Tower was hit by United Airlines Flight 175. Both 110-story skyscrapers collapsed within an hour and forty-one minutes, bringing about the destruction of the remaining five structures in the WTC complex, as well as damaging or destroying various other buildings surrounding the towers. A third flight, American Airlines Flight 77, crashed into the Pentagon at 9:37 a.m., causing a partial collapse. The fourth and final flight, United Airlines Flight 93, flew in the direction of Washington, D.C. Alerted to the previous attacks, the plane's passengers attempted to gain control of the aircraft, but the hijackers ultimately crashed the plane in a field in Stonycreek Township, Pennsylvania, near Shanksville at 10:03 a.m. Investigators determined that Flight 93 target was either the United States Capitol or the White House.\n\nWithin hours of the attacks, the Central Intelligence Agency determined that al-Qaeda was responsible. The United States formally responded by launching the war on terror and invading Afghanistan to depose the Taliban, which had not complied with U.S. demands to expel al-Qaeda from Afghanistan and extradite its leader, Osama bin Laden. The U.S.'s invocation of Article 5 of the North Atlantic Treaty\u2014its only usage to date\u2014called upon allies to fight al-Qaeda. As U.S. and NATO ground forces swept through Afghanistan, bin Laden fled to the White Mountains, where he narrowly avoided capture by U.S.-led forces. Although bin Laden initially denied any involvement, in 2004 he formally claimed responsibility for the attacks. Al-Qaeda's cited motivations included U.S. support of Israel, the presence of U.S. troops in Saudi Arabia, and sanctions against Iraq. After evading capture for almost a decade, bin Laden was killed by the U.S. military on May 2, 2011. U.S. and NATO troops remained in Afghanistan until 2021.\n\nThe attacks resulted in 2,977 non-hijacker fatalities, an indeterminate number of injuries, and substantial long-term health consequences, in addition to at least $10 billion in infrastructure and property damage. It remains the deadliest terrorist attack in human history as well as the single deadliest incident for firefighters and law enforcement officers in U.S. history, with 340 and 72 killed, respectively. The destruction of the World Trade Center and its environs seriously harmed the New York City economy and induced global market shocks. Many other countries strengthened anti-terrorism legislation and expanded their powers of law enforcement and intelligence agencies. Cleanup of the World Trade Center site (colloquially \"Ground Zero\") took eight months and was completed in May 2002, while the Pentagon was repaired within a year. After delays in the design of a replacement complex, the One World Trade Center began construction in November 2006 and opened in November 2014. Memorials to the attacks include the National September 11 Memorial & Museum in New York City, the Pentagon Memorial in Arlington County, Virginia, and the Flight 93 National Memorial at the Pennsylvania crash site."}]}

It is sometimes called international chess or Western chess to distinguish it from related games, such as xiangqi (Chinese chess) and shogi (Japanese chess). The recorded history of chess goes back at least to the emergence of a similar game, chaturanga, in seventh-century India. The rules of chess as we know them today emerged in Europe at the end of the 15th century, with standardization and universal acceptance by the end of the 19th century. Today, chess is one of the world's most popular games, played by millions of people worldwide.\n\nChess is an abstract strategy game that involves no hidden information and no use of dice or cards. It is played on a chessboard with 64 squares arranged in an eight-by-eight grid. At the start, each player controls sixteen pieces: one king, one queen, two rooks, two bishops, two knights, and eight pawns. White moves first, followed by Black. Checkmating the opponent's king involves putting the king under immediate attack (in \"check\") whereby there is no way for it to escape. There are also several ways a game can end in a draw.\n\nOrganized chess arose in the 19th century. Chess competition today is governed internationally by FIDE (the International Chess Federation). The first universally recognized World Chess Champion, Wilhelm Steinitz, claimed his title in 1886; Magnus Carlsen is the current World Champion. A huge body of chess theory has developed since the game's inception. Aspects of art are found in chess composition, and chess in its turn influenced Western culture and art, and has connections with other fields such as mathematics, computer science, and psychology.\n\nOne of the goals of early computer scientists was to create a chess-playing machine. In 1997, Deep Blue became the first computer to beat the reigning World Champion in a match when it defeated Garry Kasparov. Today's chess engines are significantly stronger than the best human players and have deeply influenced the development of chess theory.\n\nAnswer:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Chess is a two player turn based abstract strategy board game with the goal of checkmating the opponents King. The game originated from a similar board game from India called Chatarunga, which was played during the 17th century.\n\nChess boards have 64 squares arranged into an 8x8 grid with alternating white and black squares. Each player controls 16 pieces: 1 king, 1 queen, 2 bishops, 2 rooks, 2 knights, and eight pawns. Each piece has a predefined mode of movement. Each player's pieces are uniformly colored; for example if player one has the white pieces, player one will start the match. \n\nCheckmating the opponents king requires the opponent to position their pieces into an attacking arrangement that prohibits the defending players king from moving. This is usually accomplished by closing in on their defending opponents king and systematically working towards positions where the king can no longer move without being taken. If the king is under attack (meaning the king is in a position where the opponents next move will take the king) the defensive player must either take the attacking piece with any piece on the board or move the king to a position where the king is no longer under attach, this configuration is called \"Check\" or being \"Checked\". Chess matches can also end in a draw.\n\nChess arose in popularity in the 19th century and is governed internationally by the FIDE (international chess federation). Magnus Carlsen is the current world champion (2023) and the game has a huge body of theory associated with playing the game. \n\nThe game has influenced western culture in the fields of art, mathematics, computer science and psychology. Computer scientists have used chess as a method for developing algorithms that can play chess. In 1997, Deep Blue became the first computer to beat a human opponent, beating the current world champion Garry Kasparov at that time. Today's chess playing machines are significantly more powerful and have been influenced by the best chess players in the world."}]}

First, recall that irrational numbers are numbers that cannot be written as p / q for integers p and q. Assume for contradiction that the square root of 2 is rational, which would mean that sqrt(2) = p / q for some integers p and q. Further assume without loss of generality that this fraction is in reduced form, meaning that p and q share no common factors. We can assume this because any integer fraction can be written in such a reduced form, so the existence of any rational representation for sqrt(2) would imply the existence of one in reduced form. Now we square both sides of the above equation, yielding\n\n2 = p^2 / q^2\n\nfor some integers p and q not sharing any common factors. Now multiply by q^2 to get\n\n2 * q^2 = p^2\n\nNote that the left hand side is even due to the factor of 2, so the right hand side p^2 is even as well. This means that p must be even as well, otherwise p^2 would not be even. So p can be written as 2 * x for some integer x. Substituting this into the above equation, we get\n\n2 * q^2 = (2 * x)^2 = 2^2 * x^2\n\nNote that both sides of the equation have a factor of 2 we can cancel. Doing this, we get\n\nq^2 = 2 * x^2\n\nBy an argument analogous to the one above, we can conclude that q is even. However this contradicts our assumption that p and q shared no common factors. Therefore our initial assumption that sqrt(2) is rational was false, which is what we set out to prove."}]}

In plants, these proteins are held inside organelles called chloroplasts, which are most abundant in leaf cells, while in bacteria they are embedded in the plasma membrane. In these light-dependent reactions, some energy is used to strip electrons from suitable substances, such as water, producing oxygen gas. The hydrogen freed by the splitting of water is used in the creation of two further compounds that serve as short-term stores of energy, enabling its transfer to drive other reactions: these compounds are reduced nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADPH) and adenosine triphosphate (ATP), the \"energy currency\" of cells.\n\nIn plants, algae and cyanobacteria, sugars are synthesized by a subsequent sequence of light-independent reactions called the Calvin cycle. In the Calvin cycle, atmospheric carbon dioxide is incorporated into already existing organic carbon compounds, such as ribulose bisphosphate (RuBP). Using the ATP and NADPH produced by the light-dependent reactions, the resulting compounds are then reduced and removed to form further carbohydrates, such as glucose.

He was a barrister and a senior leader of the Indian National Congress, who played a leading role in the country's struggle for independence, guiding its integration into a united, independent nation.

He was a successful lawyer. One of Mahatma Gandhi's earliest political lieutenants, he organised peasants from Kheda, Borsad, and Bardoli in Gujarat in non-violent civil disobedience against the British Raj, becoming one of the most influential leaders in Gujarat. He was appointed as the 49th President of Indian National Congress, organising the party for elections in 1934 and 1937 while promoting the Quit India Movement.\n\nAs the first Home Minister and Deputy Prime Minister of India, Patel organised relief efforts for partition refugees fleeing to Punjab and Delhi from Pakistan and worked to restore peace.

The law was supposed to be a voluntary relocation program, but it was not implemented as one. Jackson's administration often achieved agreement to relocate through bribes, fraud and intimidation, and the leaders who signed the treaties often did not represent the entire tribe.

They have been referred to as Germany's most successful pop duo, and have had a number of hit singles, reaching the top five in many countries. Their most popular singles are \"You're My Heart, You're My Soul\", \"You Can Win If You Want\", \"Cheri, Cheri Lady\", \"Brother Louie\", \"Atlantis Is Calling (S.O.S. for Love)\" and \"Geronimo's Cadillac\".\nModern Talking worked together from 1983 to 1987, then the band disbanded. In 1998, they reunited and made a successful comeback, recording and releasing music from 1998 to 2003. The duo released singles (many of which involved American rapper Eric Singleton) which again entered the top ten in Germany and abroad, one of which was the re-recorded version of \"You're My Heart, You're My Soul '98\". After the duo's second and final break-up in 2003, their global sales had reached 120 million singles and albums combined.\n\nAnswer:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "First formed in West Berlin in early 1983, they unexpectedly became popular in the beginning of 1985 with \"You're My Heart, You're My Soul\", with which they occupied top ten positions in 35 countries including their homeland where the single perched at the top for six consecutive weeks, the single eventually went on to sell eight million copies worldwide. The track was then followed by another number-one hit, \"You Can Win If You Want\", which was released in the middle of 1985 from the debut album The 1st Album. The album was certified platinum in Germany for selling over 500,000 units.\n\nSoon after their second hit, Modern Talking released the single \"Cheri, Cheri Lady\" which also quickly climbed to the top of the charts in West Germany, Switzerland, Austria and Norway, meanwhile entering the top ten in Sweden and the Netherlands. The single, being the only track released from their second album Let's Talk About Love, managed to push the album to a platinum status in West Germany for sales of over 500,000. The success continued with another two number one singles, \"Brother Louie\" and \"Atlantis Is Calling (S.O.S. for Love)\", both from the third album, Ready for Romance. The duo also charted high with their sixth single \"Geronimo's Cadillac\" from the fourth album In the Middle of Nowhere, and \"Jet Airliner\" from their fifth album Romantic Warriors.\n\nDue to their lackluster received sixth album, Bohlen announced the end of the project during an interview, while Anders was in Los Angeles. This sparked further animosities between the two, who had had a tumultuous and quarreling relationship even when they were together. According to Bohlen, the main reason for breaking up the group was Anders' then-wife Nora, who refused to have her husband interviewed by female reporters, and constantly demanded huge changes made to shows, videos or recordings, a fact that Anders later admitted in his biography. After a final phone call during which both men heavily insulted each other, they refused to speak with each other for over 10 years.\n\nDuring this era, Modern Talking were successful in Europe, Asia, South America, the Middle East and in Iran. In the United Kingdom, they entered the top five only once, with the song \"Brother Louie\". In 1985, RCA signed Modern Talking for a US deal and released their first album in the US, but they remained almost unknown in North America, never appearing on the US charts. They released two albums each year between 1985 and 1987, while also promoting their singles on television all over Europe, eventually selling sixty-five million records within three years.\n\nNotably, Modern Talking were one of the first Western bloc bands allowed to sell their records in the Soviet Union. After four decades of Cold War censorship and import restrictions, Mikhail Gorbachev's Glasnost reforms in 1986 opened the Soviet sphere to Western bands, including Modern Talking at the height of their popularity. As a result, they still maintain a large fanbase in Eastern Europe.\n\nBetween 1987 and 1997\nImmediately after the duo split in mid-1987, Bohlen formed his own project called Blue System and enjoyed several high chart positions, with tracks like \"Sorry Little Sarah\", \"My Bed Is Too Big\", \"Under My Skin\", \"Love Suite\", \"Laila\" and \"D\u00e9j\u00e0 vu\". Meanwhile, Anders went solo, touring under the name of Modern Talking on several continents until the beginning of 1989, when he started to record some of his new pop-like material in LA and London, and also in his native country. Anders recorded five solo albums in English, Different, Whispers, Down on Sunset, When Will I See You Again and Souled, and one of his albums was also recorded in Spanish Barcos de Cristal. He was more successful in foreign countries than his own country, yet he also reached several hits in Germany. Despite all the quarrels and disagreements that Bohlen and Anders got into with each other in the past, they began staying in touch again after Anders moved back to Koblenz, Germany in 1994.\n\n1998\u20132003: Reunion\nIn the beginning of 1998, the duo reunited and had their first performance together in March on the German TV show Wetten, dass..?. They released a remixed version of their 1984 single \"You're My Heart, You're My Soul\", which features Eric Singleton on the rap vocals. Their first comeback album Back for Good, which included four new tracks, as well as all of the previous hits remixed with modern techniques, stayed at number one in Germany for five consecutive weeks and managed to top the charts in fifteen countries, eventually selling three million copies in Europe alone. The duo won the award for Best Selling German Band at the World Music Awards that year. The follow-up album Alone also went straight to number one in Germany and was very successful elsewhere; the album managed to sell over one million units in Europe alone.\n\nBohlen and Anders followed the 1980s Modern Talking pattern as they chose to release two singles from each album, as in the past. A series of singles and four more albums followed such as Year of the Dragon, America, Victory and Universe. After reaching the point where they had already collected over 400 gold and platinum awards worldwide, Bohlen and Anders decided to disband again in 2003 just before the release of another best-of compilation. The second break-up seemed to have been triggered mainly from the negative portrayal of Anders by Bohlen written in his autobiography published on 4 October 2003. In the course of all the disputes which eventually drove the duo to its break-up, Bohlen was involved in Deutschland sucht den Superstar (DSDS), the German edition of the UK's Pop Idol. The compilation album was released in 2003 entitled The Final Album which contained all of the duo's singles. Thomas Anders started another solo career immediately after the end of Modern Talking, while Bohlen had by now begun devoting most of his time to new talents, especially those he discovered on DSDS."}]}

Auroras display dynamic patterns of brilliant lights that appear as curtains, rays, spirals, or dynamic flickers covering the entire sky.\n\nAuroras are the result of disturbances in the magnetosphere caused by the solar wind. Major disturbances result from enhancements in the speed of the solar wind from coronal holes and coronal mass ejections. These disturbances alter the trajectories of charged particles in the magnetospheric plasma. These particles, mainly electrons and protons, precipitate into the upper atmosphere (thermosphere/exosphere). The resulting ionisation and excitation of atmospheric constituents emit light of varying colour and complexity. The form of the aurora, occurring within bands around both polar regions, is also dependent on the amount of acceleration imparted to the precipitating particles."}]}

The rhizomes should be removed from the soil using a garden fork making an attempt to keep as much root structure as possible.  The spiky leaves of the plant can be trimmed at this time to reduce the risk of the plant being disturbed by strong wind gusts when it is replanted.

The game occurs over the course of several plays, with each play generally beginning when a player on the fielding team, called the pitcher, throws a ball that a player on the batting team, called the batter, tries to hit with a bat. The objective of the offensive team (batting team) is to hit the ball into the field of play, away from the other team's players, allowing its players to run the bases, having them advance counter-clockwise around four bases to score what are called \"runs\". The objective of the defensive team (referred to as the fielding team) is to prevent batters from becoming runners, and to prevent runners' advance around the bases. A run is scored when a runner legally advances around the bases in order and touches home plate (the place where the player started as a batter).\n\nThe principal objective of the batting team is to have a player reach first base safely; this generally occurs either when the batter hits the ball and reaches first base before an opponent retrieves the ball and touches the base, or when the pitcher persists in throwing the ball out of the batter's reach. Players on the batting team who reach first base without being called \"out\" can attempt to advance to subsequent bases as a runner, either immediately or during teammates' turns batting. The fielding team tries to prevent runs by getting batters or runners \"out\", which forces them out of the field of play. The pitcher can get the batter out by throwing three pitches which result in strikes, while fielders can get the batter out by catching a batted ball before it touches the ground, and can get a runner out by tagging them with the ball while the runner is not touching a base.\n\nThe opposing teams switch back and forth between batting and fielding; the batting team's turn to bat is over once the fielding team records three outs. One turn batting for each team constitutes an inning. A game is usually composed of nine innings, and the team with the greater number of runs at the end of the game wins. Most games end after the ninth inning, but if scores are tied at that point, extra innings are usually played. Baseball has no game clock, though some competitions feature pace-of-play regulations such as the pitch clock to shorten game time.\n\nBaseball evolved from older bat-and-ball games already being played in England by the mid-18th century. This game was brought by immigrants to North America, where the modern version developed. Baseball's American origins, as well as its reputation as a source of escapism during troubled points in American history such as the American Civil War and the Great Depression, have led the sport to receive the moniker of \"America's Pastime\"; since the late 19th century, it has been unofficially recognized as the national sport of the United States, though in modern times is considered less popular than other sports, such as American football. In addition to North America, baseball is considered the most popular sport in parts of Central and South America, the Caribbean, and East Asia, particularly in Japan, South Korea, and Taiwan.\n\nAnswer:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "The principal objective of the batting team in the sport of baseball is to have a player reach first base safely; this generally occurs either when the batter hits the ball and reaches first base before an opponent retrieves the ball and touches the base, or when the pitcher persists in throwing the ball out of the batter's reach.

I have given it a lot of thought and done a great deal of research into what might be involved. I am aware that having a pet is a huge commitment so I am writing to you to explain why I think you should buy me a pet tortoise and why a tortoise is a fantastic choice of pet.\n\nLooking after a pet tortoise will give me a strong sense of responsibility. I know that I will have to ensure my tortoise is well fed, kept at the right temperature, given opportunities to bask under a heated lamp or in the sunshine if warm enough. I am very willing to give the time and commitment necessary to look after my tortoise. The tortoise will be my sole responsibility and I feel mature enough to commit to its care and happiness.\n\nAs you know, I suffer from anxiety and school makes me particularly worried sometimes. It has been shown through numerous studies that pets reduce anxiety and stress in humans. I feel sure that having a tortoise will be a fantastic distraction from my worries and bring me great enjoyment. Contrary to popular belief, tortoises love having their shells stroked and their chins tickled and I think it would be very relaxing for me to pet a tortoise when I get home from school.\n\nTortoises are very self-sufficient. Provided they are given a warm place to bask, access to fresh water and plenty of fresh food such as dandelions, kale, lettuce and other leafy vegetables, they are very happy to be left to their own devices. As we live in the UK where temperatures can be cool, we would need to purchase a tortoise table with good substrate, a basking lamp and some hides where the tortoise can tuck itself away. We have lots of space for this in our kitchen. When it is warm, the tortoise can go into our garden in an enclosure. A tortoise table and lamp will cost about \u00a3200 but this is just an initial outlay. Thereafter, keeping a tortoise is very cheap. In fact, you can pick most of their food for free by foraging which I am happy to do when we go for families walk.\n\nContrary to popular belief, tortoises can be very friendly. As I have mentioned above, they love being stroked but did you also know that they can recognise their owners and some can even respond to their names? In fact, a study showed that tortoises can recognise their previous owners that they haven\u2019t seen in years so they are both friendly and very intelligent.\nYou might be worried about hibernating a tortoise but I have done lots of research on this and now know exactly what to do. If we buy a tortoise, it will need to hibernate for a maximum of three months from the end of September. We will need to hibernate our tortoise in a well-insulated box. The temperature mustn\u2019t go above or below 5 degrees celsius and our garage would be the perfect place for it. We have a temperature gauge in there so I can keep an eye on the heat levels. \n\nFinally, I have looked into the cost of buying a tortoise. I would suggest we buy a tortoise which is a couple of years\u2019 old as they require less care. We can buy a preloved tortoise which has been microchipped for about \u00a3100. And when we go on holiday, I have found a Tortoise Hotel which is run by a vet and costs just \u00a360 for a 10 day stay.\n\nI think you will agree that I have conducted very thorough research into looking after a tortoise and I hope you will agree that I am now mature enough to look after a pet. I truly believe that a pet tortoise will give me a strong sense of responsibility and will have a positive calming effect on my mood. Indeed, I think the whole family will enjoy having a tortoise. They are friendly, loving, interesting and intelligent animals and we will all benefit from having one.\n\nI would be grateful if you would give my request full consideration.\n\nLots of Love,\n\nWilf x"}]}

However, neither where coffee was first cultivated nor direct evidence of its consumption prior to the 15th century have been found. Sufi monasteries in Yemen employed coffee as an aid to concentration during prayers. Coffee later spread to the Levant and Persia in the early 16th century; it caused some controversy on whether it was halal in Ottoman and Mamluk society. Coffee arrived in Italy the second half of the 16th century through commercial Mediterranean trade routes, while Central and Eastern Europeans learnt of coffee from the Ottomans. By the mid 17th century, it had reached India and the East Indies. Coffee houses would establish themselves in Western Europe by the late 17th century, especially in England and Germany. One of the earliest cultivations of coffee in the New World was when Gabriel de Clieu brought coffee seedlings to Martinique in 1720. These beans later sprouted 18,680 coffee trees which enabled its spread to other Caribbean islands like Saint-Domingue and also to Mexico. By 1788, Saint-Domingue supplied half the world's coffee. By 1852, globally, Brazil became the largest producer of coffee and has held that status ever since. The period since 1950 saw the widening of the playing field due to the emergence of several other major producers, notably Colombia, Ivory Coast, Ethiopia, and Vietnam; the latter overtook Colombia and became the second-largest producer in 1999. Modern production techniques along with the mass productization of coffee has made it a household item today."}]}

Following the reunion weekend, Phish embarked on a summer tour which began in May with a concert at Fenway Park in Boston. The Fenway show was followed by a 25-date tour which included performances at the 2009 edition of the Bonnaroo Music Festival in Tennessee and a four date stand at Red Rocks Amphitheatre in Colorado. At Bonnaroo, Phish was joined by Bruce Springsteen on guitar for three songs. Phish's fourteenth studio album, Joy, produced by Steve Lillywhite, was released September 8, 2009. In October, the band held Festival 8, their first multi-day festival event since Coventry in 2004, at the Empire Polo Club in Indio, California.

Separate them with a comma.\n\nIn the Encyclopedia of Food Microbiology, Michael Gaenzle writes: \"One of the oldest sourdough breads dates from 3700 BCE and was excavated in Switzerland, but the origin of sourdough fermentation likely relates to the origin of agriculture in the Fertile Crescent and Egypt several thousand years earlier\", which was confirmed a few years later by archeological evidence. ... \"Bread production relied on the use of sourdough as a leavening agent for most of human history; the use of baker's yeast as a leavening agent dates back less than 150 years.\"\n\nSourdough remained the usual form of leavening down into the European Middle Ages until being replaced by barm from the beer brewing process, and after 1871 by purpose-cultured yeast.\n\nBread made from 100% rye flour, popular in the northern half of Europe, is usually leavened with sourdough. Baker's yeast is not useful as a leavening agent for rye bread, as rye does not contain enough gluten. The structure of rye bread is based primarily on the starch in the flour as well as other carbohydrates known as pentosans; however, rye amylase is active at substantially higher temperatures than wheat amylase, causing the structure of the bread to disintegrate as the starches are broken down during baking. The lowered pH of a sourdough starter, therefore, inactivates the amylases when heat cannot, allowing the carbohydrates in the bread to gel and set properly. In the southern part of Europe, where panettone is still made with sourdough as leavening, sourdough has become less common in the 20th century; it has been replaced by the faster-growing baker's yeast, sometimes supplemented with longer fermentation rests to allow for some bacterial activity to build flavor. Sourdough fermentation re-emerged as a major fermentation process in bread production during the 2010s, although it is commonly used in conjunction with baker's yeast as leavening agent.\n\nFrench bakers brought sourdough techniques to Northern California during the California Gold Rush, and it remains a part of the culture of San Francisco today. (The nickname remains in \"Sourdough Sam\", the mascot of the San Francisco 49ers.) Sourdough has long been associated with the 1849 gold prospectors, though they were more likely to make bread with commercial yeast or baking soda. The \"celebrated\" San Francisco sourdough is a white bread characterized by a pronounced sourness, and indeed the strain of Lactobacillus in sourdough starters is named Fructilactobacillus sanfranciscensis (previously Lactobacillus sanfranciscensis), alongside the sourdough yeast Kasachstania humilis (previously Candida milleri) found in the same cultures.\n\nThe sourdough tradition was carried into Department of Alaska in the United States and the Yukon territory in Canada during the Klondike Gold Rush of 1898. Conventional leavenings such as yeast and baking soda were much less reliable in the conditions faced by the prospectors. Experienced miners and other settlers frequently carried a pouch of starter either around their neck or on a belt; these were fiercely guarded to keep from freezing. However, freezing does not kill a sourdough starter; excessive heat does. Old hands came to be called \"sourdoughs\", a term that is still applied to any Alaskan or Klondike old-timer. The significance of the nickname's association with Yukon culture was immortalized in the writings of Robert Service, particularly his collection of \"Songs of a Sourdough\".[citation needed]\n\nIn English-speaking countries, where wheat-based breads predominate, sourdough is no longer the standard method for bread leavening. It was gradually replaced, first by the use of barm from beer making, then, after the confirmation of germ theory by Louis Pasteur, by cultured yeasts. Although sourdough bread was superseded in commercial bakeries in the 20th century, it has undergone a revival among artisan bakers and, more recently, in industrial bakeries. In countries where there is no legal definition of sourdough bread, the dough for some products named or marketed as such is leavened using baker's yeast or chemical raising agents as well as, or instead of, a live sourdough starter culture. The Real Bread Campaign calls these products sourfaux.\n\nManufacturers of non-sourdough breads make up for the lack of yeast and bacterial culture by introducing into their dough an artificially-made mix known as bread improver or flour improver.\n\n"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "sourdough, baker's yeast, barm, purpose-cultured yeast, commercial yeast, baking soda, cultured yeasts, bread improver, flour improver"}]}

The three biggest concerns revolve around:\n\n1. A short growing season\n2. Cooler summers\n3. Wetter than average summers\n\nHere are some solutions you can use to mitigate these challenges.\n\nDo deal with the short growing season, you need to get a headstart on growing by using starters. What this means is that instead of planting a seed in the ground in Springtime, you start a seed indoors in late winter, grow it into a small to medium plant, then transplant that \"starter\", into the ground when the temperature is warm enough. You can buy starters from Nurseries, or start your own at home. Nursery starters are easier, but by growing at home you can experiment with more rare varieties and gain experience in cultivating a plant from the seedling stage. If you grow your own it's important to slowly climatize the plant to outdoor weather leading up to the transplant date by moving it outside starting with a couple hours a day, increasing an hour or two per day over 2-3 weeks. By using starters you essentially extend the growing season by giving your plant a multi month head start. \n\nTomatoes mature best in warm to hot climates. The pacific northwest has cooler summers than many of the growing regions in the world. There is not a lot we can do to control mother nature, but there are one or two methods to help yourself here. Certain varieties of tomatoes do better in cooler summers - try and select these. If you're using starts from a local nursery they can guide you - starts from big national box stores might not be the best for your local Northwest climate. Another technique, if you are experiencing a cooler than normal Spring and start of Summer, is to build a \"hoop house\", using PVC pipe frame and a visqueen tarp. This will let light in and act as a mini-greenhouse, trapping heat around the plant. Keep in mind tomatoes need pollinators like bees to produce fruit, so once the plan t begins to flower you'll want to ensure pollination can occur.\n\nMoisture creates issues with Tomato plants as they are very susceptible to various types of fungus that grow on the leaves. Blight is one in particular common among tomatoes. The wet summers we sometimes have create conditions on the leaves conducive to fungal growth, they can also splash fungus onto the leaves from the soil. The easiest way to deal with these two issues is in proper pruning. As early as you can prune any lower sets of leaves that could possibly come into contact with the ground. Don't do this too soon as the plant needs some leaves to grow. There are many ways to prune a tomato that you can read about, but one common one in wet areas is called single stemming - in this technique you prune \"suckers\", which are the small offshoots that grow in between the main stem and the leaf stems. By pruning the suckers you prevent too much bushy growth, which will help the leaves dry out with airflow after a rain storm. The last issue related to water is that heavy late season rains will cause the fruits to swell with water and crack. There's not an easy solution here. If it's towards the end of the season and a rainstorm is coming in, this can be a good time to pick all your fruit, your green tomatoes can be used for green salsas. Some will resort to building a tarp structure above the plants to stop the rain, though this can require a bit more work and ingenuity, and you'll need another system to keep the plants watered.\n\nOverall, growing tomatoes in the Pacific Northwest is totally possible and very rewarding. Hopefully these tips help you to have a fruitful growing season!"}]}

With the conversion to metric measures, the milk industry was concerned that the replacement of the pint bottles with 500 mL bottles would result in a 13.6% drop in milk consumption; hence, all pint bottles were recalled and replaced by 600 mL bottles. With time, due to the steadily increasing cost of collecting, transporting, storing and cleaning glass bottles, they were replaced by cardboard cartons.

Of the two, Java is the faster language, but Python is simpler and easier to learn. Each is well-established, platform-independent, and part of a large, supportive community. But that is where the similarities end. When you\u2019re considering Python versus Java, each language has different uses for different purposes, and each has pros and cons to consider.\n\nAdvantages of Java\n\nSpeed and efficiency are two of the big draws of using Java. It's also one of the coding languages considered to be easy to learn. Because many of the processes of this high-level language run automatically, you won't have to do an intense study of how everything works as much as you would with a low-level language. You should be able to master it relatively quickly depending on how much time you can devote to learning and practicing. Other advantages of using Java include the following:\n\n(1) It's simple: The syntax is straightforward, making it easy to write. It's not as complex as languages like C++, and it uses automatic memory allocation.\n\n(2) It\u2019s platform independent: You can use Java on multiple types of computers, including Windows, iOS, Unix, and Linux systems, as long as it has the Java Virtual Machine (JVM) platform.\n\n(3) It\u2019s object oriented: Because you create classes containing data and functions and objects that belong to those classes, it offers a more intuitive approach for big project development. It also provides flexibility and easier troubleshooting, and the ability to reuse the code.\n\n(4) It has a large global community: This is helpful when you're learning Java or should you run into any problems.\n\n(5) It supports multithreading: When you use Java, you can run more than one thread at a time. When running multiple threads, they share a common memory area to increase efficiency and performance.\n\n(6) It\u2019s secure: Java avoids using explicit pointers, runs inside a virtual machine called a sandbox, uses byte-code verifier to check for illegal code, and provides library-level safety along with Java security package and run-time security checks. \n\nDisadvantages of Java\n\nBefore deciding whether Java is the right programming language for you to start with, it\u2019s essential to consider its weaknesses. One of the main downsides to using Java is that it uses a large amount of memory\u2014considerably more than Python.\n\nAdditionally, Java manages its memory through garbage collection, which happens once the application you\u2019re working on no longer references the object. Java\u2019s garbage collector clears it from memory, but during the process, other threads have to stop while the garbage collector works. The step impacts the overall performance of the application. Other disadvantages include:\n\n(1) It doesn\u2019t offer control over garbage collection: As a programmer, you won\u2019t have the ability to control garbage collection using functions like free() or delete().\n\n(2) It has a lot of words: Although Java is simple, it does tend to have a lot of words in it, which will often leave you with complex, lengthy sentences and explanations.\n\n(3) It doesn't have a native look when you use it for desktops: Java has multiple graphical user interface (GUI) builders, but they aren't the best if you're creating complex UI on a desktop. Java is weaker when you're using it for desktop versus mobile when it comes to user experience and user interface. While there are many GUI builders to choose from, you'll need to do a lot of research to find the right one for your project.\n\n\nPython: The simple path\n\nAlthough Java is faster, Python is more versatile, easier to read, and has a simpler syntax. According to Stack Overflow, this general use, interpreted language is the fourth most popular coding language.  It's also one of the most in-demand programming languages that hiring managers look for when hiring candidates, according to HackerRank, second only to JavaScript. \n\nPython's popularity has experienced explosive growth in the past few years, with more than 11.3 million coders choosing to use it, mainly for IoT, data science, and machine learning applications, according to ZDNet. Further, Python has had a 25 percent growth rate, adding 2.3 million developers to its community between Q3 2020 and Q3 2021, according to SlashData's \u201cState of the Developer Nation.\u201d.\n\nAdvantages of Python\n\nPython\u2019s versatility is difficult to match, and it's so flexible that it encourages experimentation. This keeps programmers from being pigeonholed into only building one type of application. You can learn just one language and use it to make new and different things.\n\nComputer Weekly calls Python the most versatile programming language, noting that \u201cAlthough there might be a better solution for any given problem, Python will always get the job done well\u201d. Other advantages of Python include:\n\n(1) It\u2019s platform-independent: Like Java, you can use Python on various platforms, including macOS, Windows, and Linux. You\u2019ll just need an interpreter designed for that platform.\n\n(2) It allows for fast development: Because Python is dynamically typed, it's fast and friendly for development. Additionally, it uses asynchronous code to tackle situations and challenges faster because each unit of code runs separately.\n\n(3) It offers extensive libraries: Its large library supports common tasks and commands. It also contains code that can be used for many different purposes, ranging from generating documentation to unit testing to CGI.\n\n(4) It offers a more flexible approach to programming: Python supports a variety of programming styles and has multiple paradigms. Not only is this optimal for programmers who enjoy flexibility, but it also makes it ideal for start-ups that might need to shift approaches abruptly.\n\n(5) It's free and open-source: You can download Python without any cost, and because it's so easy to learn and boasts one of the largest and most active communities\u2014you should be able to start writing code in mere minutes.\n\n(6) It may boost productivity: NetGuru says that Python is more productive than Java because of how concise it is and because it's dynamically typed. Additionally, it has control capabilities and integration features that can make applications more productive.\n\nDisadvantages of Python\n\nWhile Python is arguably one of the easiest and fastest languages to learn, it\u2019s also decidedly slower to execute because it\u2019s a dynamically typed, interpreted language, executed line-by-line. Python does extra work while executing the code, making it less suitable for use in projects that depend on speed. However, if speed isn\u2019t a sensitive issue, Python\u2019s slower nature won\u2019t likely be a problem.\n\nOther potential disadvantages include:\n\n(1) It only executes one thread at a time: Python has a Global Interpreter Lock that only lets one thread execute at a time, so if you're working on a multi-threaded CPU-bound program, it'll likely be even slower. Using multiprocessing programs instead of multithreaded programs can be an effective workaround.\n\n(2) It isn't mobile native: Python can be effectively and easily used for mobile purposes, but you'll need to put a bit more effort into finding libraries that give you the necessary framework. Some examples include Kivy, which lets you use the same API to create mobile apps and software that you can run on Raspberry PI, Linux, and Windows.\n\n(3) It uses a large amount of memory: If you're working on a project where many objects are active in RAM, this could present an issue for you. Switching to NumPy could be an effective workaround to reduce the amount of memory Python uses for each object."}]}

This is due partly to their early cultivation in the Middle Eastern region known as the Fertile Crescent, made up by parts of modern Iran, Iraq, southwest Turkey, Syria, Lebanon, Palestine, Israel, and northern Egypt. Drying or dehydration also happened to be the earliest form of food preservation: grapes, dates, and figs that fell from the tree or vine would dry in the hot sun. Early hunter-gatherers observed that these fallen fruit took on an edible form, and valued them for their stability as well as their concentrated sweetness. \nThe earliest recorded mention of dried fruits can be found in Mesopotamian tablets dating to about 1500 BC, which contain what are probably the oldest known written recipes. These clay slabs, written in Akkadian, the daily language of Babylonia, were inscribed in cuneiform and tell of diets based on grains (barley, millet, wheat), vegetables and fruits such as dates, figs, apples, pomegranates, and grapes. These early civilizations used dates, date juice evaporated into syrup and raisins as sweeteners. They included dried fruits in their breads for which they had more than 300 recipes, from simple barley bread for the workers to very elaborate, spiced cakes with honey for the palaces and temples.\nThe date palm was one of the first cultivated trees. It was domesticated in Mesopotamia more than 5,000 years ago. It grew abundantly in the Fertile Crescent and it was so productive (an average date palm produces 50 kg (100 lbs) of fruit a year for 60 years or more) that dates were the cheapest of staple foods. Because they were so valuable, they were well recorded in Assyrian and Babylonian monuments and temples. The villagers in Mesopotamia dried them and ate them as sweets. Whether fresh, soft-dried or hard-dried, they helped to give character to meat dishes and grain pies. They were valued by travelers for their energy and were recommended as stimulants against fatigue.\nFigs were also prized in early Mesopotamia, Palestine, Israel, and Egypt where their daily use was probably greater than or equal to that of dates. As well as appearing in wall paintings, many specimens have been found in Egyptian tombs as funerary offerings. In Greece and Crete, figs grew very readily and they were the staple of poor and rich alike, particularly in their dried form.\nGrape cultivation first began in Armenia and the eastern regions of the Mediterranean in the 4th century BC. Raisins were produced by drying grapes in the hot desert sun. Very quickly, viticulture and raisin production spread across northern Africa including Morocco and Tunisia. The Phoenicians and the Egyptians popularized the production of raisins, probably due to the perfect arid environment for sun drying. They put them in jars for storage and allotted them to the different temples by the thousands. They also added them to breads and various pastries, some made with honey, some with milk and eggs.\nFrom the Middle East, these fruits spread through Greece to Italy where they became a major part of the diet. Ancient Romans consumed raisins in spectacular quantities and at all levels of society, including them as a key part of their common meals, along with olives and fresh fruits. Raisined breads were common for breakfast and were consumed with their grains, beans, and cultured milks. Raisins were so valued that they transcended the food realm and became rewards for successful athletes, as well as premium barter currency.\nHaving dried fruits was essential in ancient Rome as these instructions for housekeepers around 100 BC tell: \"She must keep a supply of cooked food on hand for you and the servants. She must keep many hens and have plenty of eggs. She must have a large store of dried pears, sorbs, figs, raisins, sorbs in must, preserved pears and grapes and quinces. She must also keep preserved grapes in grape-pulp and in pots buried in the ground, as well as fresh Praenestine nuts kept in the same way, and Scantian quinces in jars, and other fruits that are usually preserved, as well as wild fruits. All these she must store away diligently every year.\"\nFigs were also extremely popular in Rome. Dried figs were added to bread and formed a major part of the winter food of country people. They were rubbed with spices such as cumin, anise and fennel seeds, or toasted sesame, wrapped in fig leaves and stored in jars. Today, major producing regions include Israel, Jerusalem, Gaza and many other Arabic countries. Dried figs are rich in vitamins, phosphorus and various other important minerals.\nPlums, apricots and peaches had their origins in Asia. They were domesticated in China in the 3rd millennium BC and spread to the Fertile Crescent where they were also very popular, fresh and dried alike. They arrived in Greece and Italy much later and were very expensive but valued in the preparation of gourmet dishes with port or stewed with honey and spices.\n"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Having dried fruits was essential in ancient Rome as these instructions for housekeepers around 100 BC tell: \"She must keep a supply of cooked food on hand for you and the servants.

One concrete example of this may be the ubiquitous x86 assemblers from various vendors. Called jump-sizing, most of them are able to perform jump-instruction replacements (long jumps replaced by short or relative jumps) in any number of passes, on request.

Walt Disney died on December 15, 1966, during the initial planning of the complex. After his death, the company wrestled with the idea of whether to bring the Disney World project to fruition; however, Walt's older brother, Roy O.

Construction started in 1967, with the company instead building a resort similar to Disneyland, abandoning the experimental concepts for a planned community.

In order to understand the phenomenon, let's first break down the relationship between pressure and temperature. Warmer air has a higher pressure than cooler air, it has to do with the energy of air molecules but that is a subject for another time. When you open the refrigerator door, warmer air from the surroundings, which would be at room temperature, rushes inside the refrigerator. This is because the air flows from the higher-pressure region (the room), into the lower-pressure region (inside the refrigerator). When you shut the door, the warm air that had moved inside is now actively being cooled down by the refrigerator. Remember what we said about cooler air? The pressure inside the refrigerator starts to drop. This means that warmer air at higher pressure outside the refrigerator is trying to get in and is pushing against the door, the next time you try to open the door, you need to apply an extra force to counteract that pressure that is acting on the door. So that begs the question, why is this more noticeable a short time after you shut the door versus coming back let's say, an hour later? Glad you asked! It is because the seal that keeps the warm air outside and cool air inside the refrigerator is not a perfect seal, it is not designed to be for good reason. Over time, since the seal allows the movement of air, the pressure equalizes. In the absence of that pressure differential, there is no force acting on the outside of the door forcing it shut. Fun fact, commercial refrigerators have seals designed to allow for a lot more movement of air compared to home refrigerators. Want to guess why? It is because content inside commercial refrigerators needs to be accessed a lot more frequently. If their seals were similar to home refrigerators, people would experience the extra force each time they want to get something! It is fascinating how much thought goes into designing everyday things we take for granted!"}]}

Senators and representatives are chosen through direct election, though vacancies in the Senate may be filled by a governor's appointment. Congress has 535 voting members: 100 senators and 435 representatives. The U.S. vice president has a vote in the Senate only when senators are evenly divided. The House of Representatives has six non-voting members.\n\nThe sitting of a Congress is for a two-year term, at present, beginning every other January. Elections are held every even-numbered year on Election Day. The members of the House of Representatives are elected for the two-year term of a Congress. The Reapportionment Act of 1929 established that there be 435 representatives, and the Uniform Congressional Redistricting Act requires that they be elected from single-member constituencies or districts. It is also required that the congressional districts be apportioned among states by population every ten years using the U.S. census results, provided that each state has at least one congressional representative. Each senator is elected at-large in their state for a six-year term, with terms staggered, so every two years approximately one-third of the Senate is up for election. Each state, regardless of population or size, has two senators, so currently, there are 100 senators for the 50 states."}]}

Obama previously served as a U.S. senator representing Illinois from 2005 to 2008 and as an Illinois state senator from 1997 to 2004, and worked as a civil rights lawyer before holding public office.\n\nObama was born in Honolulu, Hawaii. After graduating from Columbia University in 1983, he worked as a community organizer in Chicago. In 1988, he enrolled in Harvard Law School, where he was the first black president of the Harvard Law Review. After graduating, he became a civil rights attorney and an academic, teaching constitutional law at the University of Chicago Law School from 1992 to 2004. Turning to elective politics, he represented the 13th district in the Illinois Senate from 1997 until 2004, when he ran for the U.S. Senate. Obama received national attention in 2004 with his March Senate primary win, his well-received keynote address at the July Democratic National Convention, and his landslide November election to the Senate. In 2008, after a close primary campaign against Hillary Clinton, he was nominated by the Democratic Party for president and chose Joe Biden as his running mate. Obama was elected over Republican nominee John McCain in the presidential election and was inaugurated on January 20, 2009. Nine months later, he was named the 2009 Nobel Peace Prize laureate, a decision that drew a mixture of praise and criticism.\n\nObama's first-term actions addressed the global financial crisis and included a major stimulus package, a partial extension of George W. Bush's tax cuts, legislation to reform health care, a major financial regulation reform bill, and the end of a major US military presence in Iraq. Obama also appointed Supreme Court justices Sonia Sotomayor and Elena Kagan, the former being the first Hispanic American on the Supreme Court. He ordered the counterterrorism raid which killed Osama bin Laden and downplayed Bush's counterinsurgency model, expanding air strikes and making extensive use of special forces while encouraging greater reliance on host-government militaries.\n\nAfter winning re-election by defeating Republican opponent Mitt Romney, Obama was sworn in for a second term on January 20, 2013. In his second term, Obama took steps to combat climate change, signing a major international climate agreement and an executive order to limit carbon emissions. Obama also presided over the implementation of the Affordable Care Act and other legislation passed in his first term, and he negotiated a nuclear agreement with Iran and normalized relations with Cuba. The number of American soldiers in Afghanistan fell dramatically during Obama's second term, though U.S. soldiers remained in Afghanistan throughout Obama's presidency.\n\nDuring Obama's terms as president, the United States' reputation abroad and the American economy improved significantly, although the country experienced high levels of partisan divide. Obama left office on January 20, 2017, and continues to reside in Washington, D.C. His presidential library in Chicago began construction in 2021. Since leaving office, Obama has remained active in Democratic politics, including campaigning for candidates in various American elections. Outside of politics, Obama has published three bestselling books: Dreams from My Father (1995), The Audacity of Hope (2006) and A Promised Land (2020). Rankings by scholars and historians, in which he has been featured since 2010, place him in the middle to upper tier of American presidents."}]}

When the car pulled behind the grandstands, one teenager fired on a crowd of 300 people with a shotgun, causing seven people to receive injuries. Six of the injured were teenagers, ranged in age from 13 to 19. One received critical injuries. All six received treatment at the Detroit Receiving Hospital. The shootings occurred at 4:15 PM, and the suspects left the scene. This shooting was the week's second shooting that had high school students involved. The shooting was the second one in a month in which Homecoming activities were involved. Police said that one of the suspects had been involved in a fight on an earlier occasion.\n\nOn April 16, 1987, a student at Murray\u2013Wright entered the school parking lot and shot 17-year-old Chester Jackson, a junior running back, in the head, killing him. The attacker went into the gymnasium and shot 18-year-old Damon Matthews, a basketball player, in the face. Tomeka Turner, an 18-year-old, was wounded. Risen said that Turner's injuries occurred \"apparently in the school's corridors as the attacker fled the building.\" The youth with facial injuries received treatment at the Detroit Receiving Hospital. The incident occurred around noon. The attacker, Michael Schofield, was 14 at the time of the crime. Schofield, 15 years old at sentencing, was sentenced to serve in a juvenile correctional facility until he turned 19. Schofield killed four people in 2003 during an attempted robbery of a convenience store in Westland, Michigan, and then killed himself. The Los Angeles Times News Service said that the 1987 Murray\u2013Wright shooting was the incident that put \"most clearly into focus\" the epidemic of youth violence in Detroit.\n\nAfter the murder and shootings, school officials started a plan to reduce violence in the school. The school was closed for two days as officials held special assemblies concerning school violence.

For the first time in the main series, the region was based on a region outside Japan, with Unova taking inspiration from the New York metropolitan area\n\nKalos\nThe Kalos region is the setting of the sixth generation of Pok\u00e9mon games, which is where the games Pok\u00e9mon X and Y take place. This region is inspired almost entirely by the northern half of Metropolitan France, with landmarks such as the Eiffel Tower and the Palace of Versailles having representations here, along with a French style of music and fashion. According to Junichi Masuda, the name \"Kalos\" comes from the Greek word \u03ba\u03ac\u03bb\u03bb\u03bf\u03c2, 'beauty'. The Kalos Pokemon League is based on the Notre-Dame de Paris due to its castle/cathedral-like exterior.\n\nAlola\nThe Alola region is the setting of the seventh generation of Pok\u00e9mon games, Pok\u00e9mon Sun, Moon, Ultra Sun and Ultra Moon. This region is based on Hawaii, marking the second time a main entry Pok\u00e9mon game setting has been inspired by a U.S. state. The name itself is a play on aloha, the Hawaiian word for both \"hello\" and \"goodbye\".\n\nGalar\nThe Galar region is the setting of the eighth generation of Pok\u00e9mon games, which is where the games Pok\u00e9mon Sword and Shield take place. This region is primarily inspired by Great Britain (mainly England and parts of Scotland), showcasing landmarks inspired by Big Ben and Hadrian's Wall. Two additional areas, The Isle of Armor and The Crown Tundra, are based on the Isle of Man and Scotland respectively. The Galar Region was also introduced in Pok\u00e9mon Journeys.\n\nPaldea\nThe Paldea region is the setting of the ninth generation Pok\u00e9mon games Pok\u00e9mon Scarlet and Violet. The region seems to be based on the Iberian Peninsula, which encompasses both Spain and Portugal.\nOutput:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "To date, regions in the Pokemon universe have been based on parts of Japan, Europe, and the United States.

Thus, an investor will take on increased risk only if compensated by higher expected returns. Conversely, an investor who wants higher expected returns must accept more risk.

A sloop is the most common. A sloop is a monohull sailboat with a single- rig mast supporting a main sail and and headsail. These are great boats to learn sailing on as their simple, easy to handle, and have great wind performance. \n\nA cutter at first look is similar to a sloop in that it also has a single mast positioned near the middle of the boat. However, a cutter uses two headsails, instead of a mainsail and headsail, and generally includes a bowsprit. This allows the boat to have better stability in rough weather due to the headsails providing a lower center of gravity. The complex rigging makes this boat more challenging to sail than the sloop, but provides an excellent option for an experienced sailor. \n\nA ketch has two masts. The main mast in the front stands taller than the mizzen mast behind it. The mizzen mast stands forward of the rudder post. The ketch has smaller sails and shorter masts. While this makes them slower than a sloop, they are very controllable in rough weather which makes them excellent boats for off shore sailing."}]}

Written in stages between 1937 and 1949, The Lord of the Rings is one of the best-selling books ever written, with over 150 million copies sold.\n\nThe title refers to the story's main antagonist, the Dark Lord Sauron, who, in an earlier age, created the One Ring to rule the other Rings of Power given to Men, Dwarves, and Elves, in his campaign to conquer all of Middle-earth. From homely beginnings in the Shire, a hobbit land reminiscent of the English countryside, the story ranges across Middle-earth, following the quest to destroy the One Ring, seen mainly through the eyes of the hobbits Frodo, Sam, Merry and Pippin. Aiding Frodo are the Wizard Gandalf, the Man Aragorn, the Elf Legolas and the Dwarf Gimli, who unite in order to rally the Free Peoples of Middle-earth against Sauron's armies and give Frodo a chance to destroy the Ring in the fire of Mount Doom.\n\nAlthough often called a trilogy, the work was intended by Tolkien to be one volume of a two-volume set along with The Silmarillion.[T 3] For economic reasons, The Lord of the Rings was published over the course of a year from 29 July 1954 to 20 October 1955 in three volumes titled The Fellowship of the Ring, The Two Towers, and The Return of the King. The work is divided internally into six books, two per volume, with several appendices of background material. Some later editions print the entire work in a single volume, following the author's original intent.\n\nTolkien's work, after an initially mixed reception by the literary establishment, has been the subject of extensive analysis of its themes and origins. Influences on this earlier work, and on the story of The Lord of the Rings, include philology, mythology, Christianity, earlier fantasy works, and his own experiences in the First World War.\n\nThe Lord of the Rings is considered one of the greatest fantasy books ever written and it has helped to create and shape the modern fantasy genre. Since release, it has been reprinted many times and translated into at least 38 languages. Its enduring popularity has led to numerous references in popular culture, the founding of many societies by fans of Tolkien's works, and the publication of many books about Tolkien and his works. It has inspired many derivative works, including paintings, music, films, television, video games, and board games.\n\nAward-winning adaptations of The Lord of the Rings have been made for radio, theatre, and film. It was named Britain's best-loved novel of all time in the BBC's 2003 poll The Big Read."}]}

Ancient Egyptian texts dating from 2750 BCE referred to these fish as the \"Thunderer of the Nile\", and described them as the \"protectors\" of all other fish. Electric fish were again reported millennia later by ancient Greek, Roman and Arabic naturalists and physicians. Several ancient writers, such as Pliny the Elder and Scribonius Largus, attested to the numbing effect of electric shocks delivered by electric catfish and electric rays, and knew that such shocks could travel along conducting objects. Patients with ailments such as gout or headache were directed to touch electric fish in the hope that the powerful jolt might cure them.\nAncient cultures around the Mediterranean knew that certain objects, such as rods of amber, could be rubbed with cat's fur to attract light objects like feathers. Thales of Miletus made a series of observations on static electricity around 600 BCE, from which he believed that friction rendered amber magnetic, in contrast to minerals such as magnetite, which needed no rubbing.\nThales was incorrect in believing the attraction was due to a magnetic effect, but later science would prove a link between magnetism and electricity. According to a controversial theory, the Parthians may have had knowledge of electroplating, based on the 1936 discovery of the Baghdad Battery, which resembles a galvanic cell, though it is uncertain whether the artifact was electrical in nature.\nElectricity would remain little more than an intellectual curiosity for millennia until 1600, when the English scientist William Gilbert wrote De Magnete, in which he made a careful study of electricity and magnetism, distinguishing the lodestone effect from static electricity produced by rubbing amber. He coined the New Latin word electricus (\"of amber\" or \"like amber\",, elektron, the Greek word for \"amber\") to refer to the property of attracting small objects after being rubbed. This association gave rise to the English words \"electric\" and \"electricity\", which made their first appearance in print in Thomas Browne's Pseudodoxia Epidemica of 1646.\nFurther work was conducted in the 17th and early 18th centuries by Otto von Guericke, Robert Boyle, Stephen Gray and C. F. du Fay. Later in the 18th century, Benjamin Franklin conducted extensive research in electricity, selling his possessions to fund his work. In June 1752 he is reputed to have attached a metal key to the bottom of a dampened kite string and flown the kite in a storm-threatened sky. A succession of sparks jumping from the key to the back of his hand showed that lightning was indeed electrical in nature. He also explained the apparently paradoxical behavior of the Leyden jar as a device for storing large amounts of electrical charge in terms of electricity consisting of both positive and negative charges\nIn 1775, Hugh Williamson reported a series of experiments to the Royal Society on the shocks delivered by the electric eel; that same year the surgeon and anatomist John Hunter described the structure of the fish's electric organs. In 1791, Luigi Galvani published his discovery of bioelectromagnetics, demonstrating that electricity was the medium by which neurons passed signals to the muscles. Alessandro Volta's battery, or voltaic pile, of 1800, made from alternating layers of zinc and copper, provided scientists with a more reliable source of electrical energy than the electrostatic machines previously used. The recognition of electromagnetism, the unity of electric and magnetic phenomena, is due to Hans Christian \u00d8rsted and Andr\u00e9-Marie Amp\u00e8re in 1819\u20131820. Michael Faraday invented the electric motor in 1821, and Georg Ohm mathematically analysed the electrical circuit in 1827. Electricity and magnetism (and light) were definitively linked by James Clerk Maxwell, in particular in his \"On Physical Lines of Force\" in 1861 and 1862.\u200a\nWhile the early 19th century had seen rapid progress in electrical science, the late 19th century would see the greatest progress in electrical engineering. Through such people as Alexander Graham Bell, Ott\u00f3 Bl\u00e1thy, Thomas Edison, Galileo Ferraris, Oliver Heaviside, \u00c1nyos Jedlik, William Thomson, 1st Baron Kelvin, Charles Algernon Parsons, Werner von Siemens, Joseph Swan, Reginald Fessenden, Nikola Tesla and George Westinghouse, electricity turned from a scientific curiosity into an essential tool for modern life.\nIn 1887, Heinrich Hertz discovered that electrodes illuminated with ultraviolet light create electric sparks more easily. In 1905, Albert Einstein published a paper that explained experimental data from the photoelectric effect as being the result of light energy being carried in discrete quantized packets, energising electrons. This discovery led to the quantum revolution. Einstein was awarded the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1921 for \"his discovery of the law of the photoelectric effect\". The photoelectric effect is also employed in photocells such as can be found in solar panels.\nThe first solid-state device was the \"cat's-whisker detector\" first used in the 1900s in radio receivers. A whisker-like wire is placed lightly in contact with a solid crystal (such as a germanium crystal) to detect a radio signal by the contact junction effect. In a solid-state component, the current is confined to solid elements and compounds engineered specifically to switch and amplify it. Current flow can be understood in two forms: as negatively charged electrons, and as positively charged electron deficiencies called holes. These charges and holes are understood in terms of quantum physics. The building material is most often a crystalline semiconductor.\nSolid-state electronics came into its own with the emergence of transistor technology. The first working transistor, a germanium-based point-contact transistor, was invented by John Bardeen and Walter Houser Brattain at Bell Labs in 1947, followed by the bipolar junction transistor in 1948.\n\n"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Electricity would remain little more than an intellectual curiosity for millennia until 1600, when the English scientist William Gilbert wrote De Magnete, in which he made a careful study of electricity and magnetism, distinguishing the lodestone effect from static electricity produced by rubbing amber.

The area is a heartland of Vietnamese Buddhism, and at the time, activist Buddhist monks and civilians were at the forefront of opposition to a series of military juntas that had been ruling the nation, as well as prominently questioning the escalation of the Vietnam War.\n\nDuring the rule of the Catholic Ng\u00f4 \u0110\u00ecnh Di\u1ec7m, the discrimination against the majority Buddhist population generated the growth of Buddhist institutions as they sought to participate in national politics and gain better treatment. In 1965, after a series of military coups that followed the fall of the Di\u1ec7m regime in 1963, Air Marshal Nguy\u1ec5n Cao K\u1ef3 and General Nguy\u1ec5n V\u0103n Thi\u1ec7u finally established a stable junta, holding the positions of Prime Minister and figurehead Chief of State respectively. The K\u1ef3-Thi\u1ec7u regime was initially almost a feudal system, being more of an alliance of warlords than a state as each corps commander ruled his area as his own fiefdom, handing some of the taxes they collected over to the government in Saigon and keeping the rest for themselves. During that time, suspicion and tension continued between the Buddhist and Catholic factions in Vietnamese society.\n\nThe religious factor combined with a power struggle between K\u1ef3 and General Nguy\u1ec5n Ch\u00e1nh Thi, the commander of I Corps, a Buddhist local to the region and popular in the area. Thi was a strong-willed officer regarded as a capable commander, and K\u1ef3 saw him as a threat, as did others within the junta. In February 1966, K\u1ef3 attended a summit in Honolulu, where he became convinced that he now had American support to move against Thi, the strongest and most able of the corps commanders. In March 1966, K\u1ef3 fired Thi and ordered him into exile in the United States under the false pretense of medical treatment. This prompted both civilians and some I Corps units to launch widespread civil protests against K\u1ef3's regime and halt military operations against Viet Cong. K\u1ef3 gambled by allowing Thi to return to I Corps before departing for the US, but the arrival of the general to his native area only fuelled anti-K\u1ef3 sentiment. The Buddhist activists, students and Thi loyalists in the military coalesced into the \"Struggle Movement\", calling for a return to civilian rule and elections. Meanwhile, Thi stayed in I Corps and did not leave; strikes and protests stopped civilian activity in the area, government radio stations were taken over and used for anti-K\u1ef3 campaigning, and military operations ceased. Riots also spread to the capital Saigon and other cities further south.\n\nAt the start of April, K\u1ef3 decided to move. He declared that Da Nang, the main centre in I Corps, was under communist control and publicly vowed to kill the mayor, who had expressed support for the Struggle Movement. K\u1ef3 moved military forces into the city and travelled there to prepare for an assault, but had to withdraw and then start discussions with Buddhist leaders, as it was obvious that he was not strong enough to crush the opposition.

During the previous month, American forces had also become involved in the stand-off, and the Struggle Movement viewed their participation as biased towards K\u1ef3, leading to some tense confrontations.\n\nIn the second half of May, K\u1ef3's forces began to force the issue and gradually wore down the Struggle Movement as the rebel I Corps forces were worn down, despite some American objections that his aggressive attacks had the potential to cause too much collateral damage. At one stage, K\u1ef3's forces ended up in a skirmish with American forces, and later, the Americans were in the middle of a stand-off between the Vietnamese factions regarding a mined bridge. As K\u1ef3's forces took back Da Nang and Hu\u1ebf in street fighting, Struggle Movement supporters saw American intervention as being pro-K\u1ef3, and anti-US riots resulted in some American buildings being burnt down.

(/\u02cclu\u02d0lu\u02c8l\u025bm\u0259n/; styled in all lowercase) is a Canadian multinational athletic apparel retailer headquartered in British Columbia and incorporated in Delaware, United States. It was founded in 1998 as a retailer of yoga pants and other yoga wear, and has expanded to also sell athletic wear, lifestyle apparel, accessories, and personal care products. The company has 574 stores internationally, and also sells online.\n\nHistory\nLululemon was founded in 1998 by Chip Wilson in Vancouver, with its first standalone store opening in November 2000. Wilson created the name to have many L's so that it would sound western to Japanese buyers, who often have difficulty pronouncing the letter. He later remarked that he found it \"funny to watch [Japanese speakers] try and say it\" and that \"it was the only reason behind the name\".\n\nThe company's initial public offering was in July 2007, raising $327.6 million by selling 18.2 million shares. Christine Day, a former co-president of Starbucks, became chief executive officer in 2008.\n\nIn 2013, the company made its third consecutive appearance on Fortune's Fastest-Growing Companies list. In December 2013, founder Chip Wilson announced his resignation as chairman, and that the president of TOMS Shoes, Laurent Potdevin, would become CEO.\n\nIn 2014, Lululemon opened its first store in Europe, a flagship shop in Covent Garden, London. In February 2015, Wilson announced that he was resigning from the board, and that Michael Casey, former lead director of the board, would replace him. In 2018, Laurent Potdevin resigned as CEO and from the company's board due to misconduct.\n\nFrom its founding through 2015, Lululemon incorporated elements of Landmark Forum into its leadership and development training. According to a company source, seventy per cent of managers are hired internally. Store managers are responsible for their store's layout, color coordination, and community involvement.\n\nIn 2019, Lululemon announced an investment in MIRROR, a fitness startup that sells an interactive mirror with a camera and speakers for at-home workouts. The companies planned to create new content for the device, starting with meditation classes. In June 2020, Lululemon announced a $500 million deal to purchase MIRROR, capitalizing on a growing trend of people conducting virtual workouts at home instead of going to a gym due to the COVID-19 pandemic. The company eventually took a post-tax impairment charge of $442.7 million related to the acquisition at the end of fiscal 2022.\n\nProducts\nLululemon sells athletic wear including tops, yoga pants \u2013 a product that the company invented, shorts, sweaters, jackets and undergarments, as well as hair accessories, bags, yoga mats, water bottles, and personal care products such as deodorant and dry shampoo. Lululemon trademarked its original fabric, Luon, which included a higher-than-average amount of nylon microfiber, in 2005. Since then, the company has produced several different types of fabrics, including compression and moisture-wicking designs. Lululemon is primarily known for their leggings, which first made the brand popular.\n\nLululemon maintains a research and development lab, \"Whitespace,\" within its headquarters. It has around 50 employees including scientists and physiologists.\n\nIn 2019, the company launched a luxury streetwear brand called Lab in a few of its stores. In the same year, the company announced plans to double its men's business in the next five years beyond its women's and accessory business, competing against other athletic wear such as Nike and Under Armour.\n\nMarketing\nTwo Lululemon stores with their products in exhibition, (left) Promenade; (right): Hong Kong\nOriginally known for women's yoga apparel, by 2019 Lululemon had grown by acquiring more male customers and adapting its product and marketing strategies accordingly; it plans to increase awareness of its brand among men. The company has been stated to use \"holistic guerrilla marketing\", aiming to make customers feel that by wearing Lululemon clothing they are part of a larger community. It uses social media including Facebook, Twitter and Instagram as a main method of marketing the company and its products. Lululemon offers fitness instructors 25 percent off their orders.\n\nControversies\nIn November 2007, The New York Times reported that Lululemon made false claims about its Vitasea clothing product; the firm had claimed that the clothing, made from seaweed, provided \"anti-inflammatory, antibacterial, hydrating and detoxifying benefits\" but laboratory tests failed to find significant differences in mineral levels between ordinary T-shirt cotton and Vitasea fabric. Lululemon was subsequently forced to remove all health claims from its seaweed-based products marketed in Canada, following a demand from a Canadian oversight agency, the Competition Bureau of Canada.\n\nIn 2013, some customers complained that the clothing was of poor quality, with some items being \"too sheer\", having holes appear, and falling apart after a few uses. In December 2010, Lululemon recalled some of the store's reusable bags that were made from polypropylene, based on reports of high levels of lead. In 2013, Lululemon recalled its black yoga pants that were unintentionally transparent and \"too thin\"; the recall, which amounted to approximately 17 percent of all women's pants sold in its stores, impacted its financial results. The resulting financial loss and damage to the brand led to the forced departure of the company's Chief product officer, Sheree Waterson, and of its CEO, Christine Day.\n\nFounder Chip Wilson has made numerous controversial statements. In a 2004 interview, Wilson mocked Japanese pronunciation of the company's name. In 2013 he said that the company did not make clothes for plus-size women because it was too costly. In an effort to explain away excessive pilling in the brand's clothing, he blamed some customers for wearing Lululemon's clothes improperly or for having body shapes inconsistent with his clothes. In an interview for Bloomberg TV in 2013, he stated that some women's bodies were unsuitable for the brand's clothing. Time called the remarks \"fat shaming\". Comments such as these reportedly led to Wilson's resignation as chairman. In June 2016, Wilson published an open letter to shareholders stating that the company had \"lost its way\" and given up market share to Nike and Under Armour, after he was denied the opportunity to speak at the company's annual meetings. Since then, Wilson has used his website \"Elevate Lululemon\" to criticize the brand and business.\n\nIn 2012, Lululemon filed a lawsuit against Calvin Klein and supplier G-III Apparel Group for infringement of three of its design patents for yoga pants. The lawsuit was somewhat unusual as it involved a designer seeking to assert intellectual property protection in clothing through patent rights. The case was settled out of court the same year.\n\nIn 2021, a Business Insider report revealed that an unnamed company director pushed employees to create an All Lives Matter campaign to be displayed on its website in response to the murder of George Floyd. Employees pushed back but were told to move forward and create a mock up with the All Lives Matter copy, however they also created a Black Lives Matter artwork mock up that in the end was selected instead. The director apologized to 200 members of the company over conference call and subsequently left the company.\n\nIn September 2022, 1,698 yoga teachers and students via advocacy groups Stand.earth and Actions Speaks Louder wrote to the company demanding a transition to 100% renewable energy by 2030. They claimed that roughly half of the firm's energy came from coal production.\n\n"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "- False claims about one of their products in 2007\n- Poor quality complains about clothing material in 2013\n- Ex-CEO's controversial statements in numerous occasions between 2004 and 2016\n- Lawsuit against Calvin Klein and supplier G-III Apparel Group on patent rights in 2012\n- An internal dispute over an All Lives Matter campaign pushed by an unnamed director who later apologized and left the company\n- A public demand of the company to transition to renewable energy from coal energy from a group of yoga teachers and students in 2022"}]}

In reality, it will give the impression that one does not need to breathe, while the body is actually experiencing a blood-oxygen level that would normally, and indirectly, invoke a strong dyspnea and eventually involuntary breathing. Some have incorrectly attributed the effect of hyperventilation to increased oxygen in the blood, not realizing that it is actually due to a decrease in CO2 in the blood and lungs. Blood leaving the lungs is normally fully saturated with oxygen, so hyperventilation of normal air cannot increase the amount of oxygen available, as oxygen in blood is the direct factor. Lowering the CO2 concentration increases the pH of the blood, thus increasing the time before blood becomes acidic enough so the respiratory center becomes stimulated, as described above. \nThe primary urge to breathe is triggered by rising carbon dioxide (CO2) levels in the bloodstream. Carbon dioxide builds up in the bloodstream when oxygen is metabolized and it needs to be expelled as a waste product. The body detects carbon dioxide levels very accurately and relies on this as the primary trigger to control breathing. Hyperventilation artificially depletes the resting concentration of carbon dioxide causing a low blood carbon dioxide condition called hypocapnia. Hypocapnia reduces the reflexive respiratory drive, allowing the delay of breathing and leaving the diver susceptible to loss of consciousness from hypoxia. For most healthy people, the first sign of low oxygen levels is a greyout or unconsciousness: there is no bodily sensation that warns a diver of an impending blackout.\nIf a person loses consciousness underwater, there is considerable danger that they will drown. An alert diving partner or nearby lifeguard would be in the best position to rescue such a person. Static apnea blackout occurs at the surface when a motionless diver holds their breath long enough for the circulating oxygen in blood to fall below that required for the brain to maintain consciousness. It involves no pressure changes in the body and is usually performed to enhance breath-hold time. It should never be practiced alone, but under strict safety protocols with a safety guard or equipment beside the diver.\n"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Hyperventilation does not increase the amount of oxygen available but artificially decreases carbon dioxide (CO2) levels in blood and lungs. \nBecause the primary urge to breathe is triggered by rising carbon dioxide levels, it gives false impression that one does not need to breath.

Before \u65e5\u672c was adopted in the early 8th century, the country was known in China as Wa (\u502d, changed in Japan around 757 to \u548c) and in Japan by the endonym Yamato. Nippon, the original Sino-Japanese reading of the characters, is favored for official uses, including on banknotes and postage stamps. Nihon is typically used in everyday speech and reflects shifts in Japanese phonology during the Edo period. The characters \u65e5\u672c mean \"sun origin\", which is the source of the popular Western epithet \"Land of the Rising Sun\". The name \"Japan\" is based on Chinese pronunciations of \u65e5\u672c and was introduced to European languages through early trade.

For example, the ABO blood grouping is controlled by the ABO gene, which has six common alleles (variants). In population genetics, nearly every living human's phenotype for the ABO gene is some combination of just these six alleles.\n\nMost alleles observed result in little or no change in the function of the gene product it codes for. However, sometimes, different alleles can result in different observable phenotypic traits, such as different pigmentation. A notable example of this is Gregor Mendel's discovery that the white and purple flower colors in pea plants were the result of a single gene with two alleles.\n\nNearly all multicellular organisms have two sets of chromosomes at some point in their biological life cycle; that is, they are diploid. In this case, the chromosomes can be paired. Each chromosome in the pair contains the same genes in the same order, and place, along the length of the chromosome. For a given gene, if the two chromosomes contain the same allele, they, and the organism, are homozygous with respect to that gene. If the alleles are different, they, and the organism, are heterozygous with respect to that gene."}]}

The field was pioneered by Richard R. Ernst and Kurt W\u00fcthrich at the ETH, and by Ad Bax, Marius Clore, Angela Gronenborn at the NIH, and Gerhard Wagner at Harvard University, among others. Structure determination by NMR spectroscopy usually consists of several phases, each using a separate set of highly specialized techniques. The sample is prepared, measurements are made, interpretive approaches are applied, and a structure is calculated and validated.\n\nNMR involves the quantum-mechanical properties of the central core (\"nucleus\") of the atom. These properties depend on the local molecular environment, and their measurement provides a map of how the atoms are linked chemically, how close they are in space, and how rapidly they move with respect to each other. These properties are fundamentally the same as those used in the more familiar magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), but the molecular applications use a somewhat different approach, appropriate to the change of scale from millimeters (of interest to radiologists) to nanometers (bonded atoms are typically a fraction of a nanometer apart), a factor of a million. This change of scale requires much higher sensitivity of detection and stability for long term measurement. In contrast to MRI, structural biology studies do not directly generate an image, but rely on complex computer calculations to generate three-dimensional molecular models.\n\nCurrently most samples are examined in a solution in water, but methods are being developed to also work with solid samples. Data collection relies on placing the sample inside a powerful magnet, sending radio frequency signals through the sample, and measuring the absorption of those signals. Depending on the environment of atoms within the protein, the nuclei of individual atoms will absorb different frequencies of radio signals. Furthermore, the absorption signals of different nuclei may be perturbed by adjacent nuclei. This information can be used to determine the distance between nuclei. These distances in turn can be used to determine the overall structure of the protein.\n\nA typical study might involve how two proteins interact with each other, possibly with a view to developing small molecules that can be used to probe the normal biology of the interaction (\"chemical biology\") or to provide possible leads for pharmaceutical use (drug development). Frequently, the interacting pair of proteins may have been identified by studies of human genetics, indicating the interaction can be disrupted by unfavorable mutations, or they may play a key role in the normal biology of a \"model\" organism like the fruit fly, yeast, the worm C. elegans, or mice. To prepare a sample, methods of molecular biology are typically used to make quantities by bacterial fermentation. This also permits changing the isotopic composition of the molecule, which is desirable because the isotopes behave differently and provide methods for identifying overlapping NMR signals."}]}

It includes any method or technology that is used to determine the order of the four bases: adenine, guanine, cytosine, and thymine. The advent of rapid DNA sequencing methods has greatly accelerated biological and medical research and discovery.\n\nKnowledge of DNA sequences has become indispensable for basic biological research, DNA Genographic Projects and in numerous applied fields such as medical diagnosis, biotechnology, forensic biology, virology and biological systematics. Comparing healthy and mutated DNA sequences can diagnose different diseases including various cancers, characterize antibody repertoire, and can be used to guide patient treatment. Having a quick way to sequence DNA allows for faster and more individualized medical care to be administered, and for more organisms to be identified and cataloged.\n\nThe rapid speed of sequencing attained with modern DNA sequencing technology has been instrumental in the sequencing of complete DNA sequences, or genomes, of numerous types and species of life, including the human genome and other complete DNA sequences of many animal, plant, and microbial species.\n\nThe first DNA sequences were obtained in the early 1970s by academic researchers using laborious methods based on two-dimensional chromatography. Following the development of fluorescence-based sequencing methods with a DNA sequencer, DNA sequencing has become easier and orders of magnitude faster.["}]}

The tour is approx. 40 mins long and you discover that gravity doesn't behave like it should or what should be higher than you turns out to be at same height or lower. You make a steep quick climb to a tilted cabin on a tilted road and you feel disoriented and seem to be at a severe incline when you enter this cabin. While there are various hypotheses as to reason for these effects, the most likely explanation is some level of optical illusion as the road is tilted at a severe opposite angle to the tilted roof line and the inside of the cabin. I think a combination of gravity hill where you get the sensation you are climbing up the road when in reality you are going down and the odd tilted angles of the cabin causes severe optical illusion. It also causes humans to fall back on visual senses more and ignore other senses which might be counter acting what you see."}]}

In an interview with CNN Philippines, Roque, a former UP law professor and human rights lawyer, replied to a tweet from UP professor Danilo Arao that questions his honor and excellence, by saying that he already asked the defense secretary and the UP president to settle down. When asked about his personal opinion about the decision, he said, \"there's really no such thing when you are a presidential spokesperson.\"\n\nVice President Leni Robredo, on the other hand, denounced the decision and said that the decision was meant to silence the critics of the administration. On January 20, Senators Joel Villanueva, Sonny Angara, Nancy Binay, and Grace Poe filed a bill in the Senate to institutionalize the accord into Republic Act No. 9005, or the University of the Philippines Charter of 2008. Several lawmakers from both branches of Congress have also expressed their concerns and disagreements with the DND's decision.\n\nUP President Danilo Concepcion said that the termination of the agreement was \"totally unnecessary and unwarranted\" and was made without consulting the UP administration. UP Student Regent Renee Co, meanwhile, called the decision \"one of the [government's] worst attempts at destroying the institutional safeguards that UP students have fought to put in their struggle for their democratic rights.\"\n\nOn January 19, the UP held a rally to condemn the termination of the agreement. The hashtag #DefendUP was trended on Twitter with some discussion pointed to the Duterte administration, stating that \"this is another way of the administration to threaten and silence activists who have opposed President Duterte's several policies, especially on supposed red-tagging activities and on the COVID-19 pandemic response.\"\nOutput:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "The 1989 University of the Philippines\u2013Department of National Defense accord (UP\u2013DND accord) was a bilateral agreement between the Department of National Defense (DND) and the University of the Philippines (UP) that restricted military and police access and operations inside the university.

In an interview with CNN Philippines, Roque, a former UP law professor and human rights lawyer, replied to a tweet from UP professor Danilo Arao that questioned his honour and excellence, saying that he had already asked the defence secretary and the UP president to settle down. Vice President Leni Robredo, on the other hand, denounced the decision and said that the decision was meant to silence the administration's critics. On January 20, Senators Joel Villanueva, Sonny Angara, Nancy Binay, and Grace Poe filed a bill in the Senate to institutionalize the accord into Republic Act No. 9005, or the University of the Philippines Charter of 2008. Several lawmakers from both branches of Congress have also expressed their concerns and disagreements with the DND's decision. UP President Danilo Concepcion said that the termination of the agreement was \"unnecessary and unwarranted\" and was made without consulting the UP administration. Meanwhile, UP Student Regent Renee Co called the decision \"one of the [government's] worst attempts at destroying the institutional safeguards that UP students have fought to put in their struggle for their democratic rights.\""}]}

The presence or absence of rhoticity is one of the most prominent distinctions by which varieties of English can be classified. In rhotic varieties, the historical English /r/ sound is preserved in all pronunciation contexts. In non-rhotic varieties, speakers no longer pronounce /r/ in postvocalic environments\u2014that is, when it is immediately after a vowel and not followed by another vowel. For example, in isolation, a rhotic English speaker pronounces the words hard and butter as /\u02c8h\u0251\u02d0rd/ and /\u02c8b\u028ct\u0259r/, whereas a non-rhotic speaker \"drops\" or \"deletes\" the /r/ sound, pronouncing them as /\u02c8h\u0251\u02d0d/ and /\u02c8b\u028ct\u0259/. When an r is at the end of a word but the next word begins with a vowel, as in the phrase \"better apples\", most non-rhotic speakers will pronounce the /r/ in that position (the linking R), since it is followed by a vowel in this case.\n\nThe rhotic varieties of English include the dialects of South West England, Scotland, Ireland, and most of the United States and Canada. The non-rhotic varieties include most of the dialects of modern England, Wales, Australia, New Zealand, and South Africa. In some varieties, such as those of some parts of the southern and northeastern United States, rhoticity is a sociolinguistic variable: postvocalic r is deleted depending on an array of social factors, such as being more correlated today with lower socioeconomic status, greater age, certain ethnic identities, and less formal speaking contexts.\n\nEvidence from written documents suggests that loss of postvocalic /r/ began sporadically during the mid-15th century, although these /r/-less spellings were uncommon and were restricted to private documents, especially ones written by women in England. In the mid-18th century, postvocalic /r/ was still pronounced in most environments, but by the 1740s to 1770s it was often deleted entirely, especially after low vowels. By the early 19th century, the southern British standard was fully transformed into a non-rhotic variety, though some variation persisted as late as the 1870s.\n\nIn the 18th century (and possibly 17th century), the loss of postvocalic /r/ in British English influenced southern and eastern American port cities with close connections to Britain, causing their upper-class pronunciation to become non-rhotic while the rest of the United States remained rhotic. Non-rhotic pronunciation continued to influence American prestige speech until the 1860s, when the American Civil War began to shift America's centers of wealth and political power to rhotic areas with fewer cultural connections to the old colonial and British elites. In the United States, non-rhotic speech continued to hold some level of prestige up until the mid-20th century, but rhotic speech in particular became prestigious nationwide rapidly after the Second World War, reflected in the national standard of radio and television since the mid-20th century embracing historical /r/.\nOutput:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "In rhotic English dialects, the historical English /r/ sound is preserved in all pronunciation contexts.

Glyn was commenting on a report underscoring the dilemma of rocketing house prices outstripping what locals could pay, with the report warning that \"...traditional Welsh communities could die out...\" as a consequence.\n\nIn 2001 nearly a third of all purchases of properties in Gwynedd were by buyers from out of the county, with some communities reporting as many as a third of local homes used as holiday homes. Holiday home owners typically spend less than six months of the year in the local community.\n\nThe issue of locals being priced out of the local housing market is common to many rural communities throughout Britain, but in Wales the added dimension of language further complicates the issue, as many new residents do not learn the Welsh language.\n\nConcerned for the Welsh language under these pressures, Glyn said \"Once you have more than 50% of anybody living in a community that speaks a foreign language, then you lose your indigenous tongue almost immediately\". His comments attracted strong criticism of Plaid Cymru from other national parties.\n\nBy spring 2002 both the Snowdonia National Park (Welsh: Parc Cenedlaethol Eryri) and Pembrokeshire Coast National Park (Welsh: Parc Cenedlaethol Arfordir Penfro) authorities began limiting second home ownership within the parks, following the example set by Exmoor.

To combat this phenomenon, two national parks in the county started limiting second home ownership in the area, requiring proof of local need or strong ties in the area."}]}

It is mostly regarded as an \"upper-class\" sport reserved for members of private country clubs, but has gained a lot of popularity over the last few decades. As a result, golf has become more broadly accessible to the general public, and today the sport is enjoyed by tens of millions of people around the world. \n\nIn golf, there are a total of eighteen stretches of grass, known as holes. Each hole is comprised of a tee box, where the golfer hits his or her initial shot, the fairway, and the green. Most holes also include deep grass that runs along the fairways, known as \"the rough\". For added difficulty, holes can also contain hazards like sand bunkers or bodies of water like ponds and creeks. A small circular hole is located on every green and is marked with a flag so that golfers can see it from far away. The objective is to get your golf ball from the tee box into that small hole in as few shots (known as \"strokes\") as possible. Golfers advance their ball by striking it with a golf club, and each ball strike is counted as a stroke. Golfers are allowed to use up to 14 golf clubs over the course of their round, each of which is used for different purposes, from different distances. Some clubs, like the driver, are used to hit the ball very long distances. In fact, most professional golfers are able to drive the ball over 300 yards. That's the length of three football fields! A combination of clubs called irons make up the majority of a set of golf clubs. They are are generally used to advance the ball to the green after the golfer hits his or her initial tee shot. The club face of each iron is designed with a different loft angle. Higher loft angles enable golfers to hit the ball higher in the air and shorter distances, whereas low loft angles produce lower trajectory shots that travel longer distances. The most frequently used club in the set is the putter, which is used to tap the ball from wherever it lies on the green into the hole. On average, most good golfers will putt the ball twice per hole, or approximately 36 times per round. \n\nGolf holes are designated as par 3, par 4, or par 5, depending on their length. These numbers are an indication of how many strokes it should take for a professional golfer to complete the hole. Par 3 holes are shorter, and should take a single stroke to get the ball from tee to green. Par 5 holes are longer, and should typically take three strokes to get from tee to green. Most golf courses have four par 3 holes, four par 5 holes, and ten par 4 holes, yielding an aggregate of par 72. At the end of a round of golf, players calculate their final score by aggregating their total number of strokes across all eighteen holes. Over time, the golfer's skill level is assessed by his or her \"handicap\", which is a system that reflects the average number of strokes over par that the player typically shoots. For example, if one's average round score is 79, their handicap is 7 because it's 7 strokes above par. The lower the handicap, the better the golfer."}]}

He won election to the New York State Senate in 1910 and then served as Assistant Secretary of the Navy under president Woodrow Wilson during World War I. Roosevelt was James M. Cox's running mate on the Democratic Party's ticket in the 1920 United States presidential election, but Cox was defeated by Republican Warren G. Harding. In 1921, Roosevelt contracted a paralytic illness that permanently paralyzed his legs. He returned to public office by winning the 1928 New York gubernatorial election. He served as governor of New York from 1929 to 1933, promoting programs to combat the Great Depression besetting the United States at the time. In the 1932 presidential election, Roosevelt defeated Republican incumbent president Herbert Hoover in a landslide.\n\nDuring his first 100 days as president, Roosevelt spearheaded unprecedented federal legislation and issued a profusion of executive orders that instituted the New Deal. He created numerous programs to provide relief to the unemployed and farmers while seeking economic recovery with the National Recovery Administration and other programs. He also instituted major regulatory reforms related to finance, communications, and labor, and presided over the end of Prohibition. In 1936, Roosevelt won a landslide reelection with the economy having improved rapidly from 1933, but the economy relapsed into a deep recession in 1937 and 1938. Later, Roosevelt unsuccessfully sought passage of the Judicial Procedures Reform Bill of 1937. The conservative coalition formed in 1937 to block the implementation of further New Deal programs and reforms. He ran successfully for reelection in 1940, becoming the only American president to serve for more than two terms.\n\nWith World War II looming after 1938 in addition to the Japanese invasion of China and the aggression of Nazi Germany, Roosevelt gave strong diplomatic and financial support to China as well as the United Kingdom and the Soviet Union while the United States remained officially neutral. Following the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor on December 7, 1941, he obtained a declaration of war on Japan the next day, and a few days later, on Germany and Italy. He worked closely with other national leaders in leading the Allies against the Axis powers. Roosevelt supervised the mobilization of the American economy to support the war effort and implemented a Europe first strategy. He also initiated the development of the world's first atomic bomb and worked with the other Allied leaders to lay the groundwork for the United Nations and other post-war institutions. He won reelection in 1944 but with his physical health seriously and steadily declining during the war years, he died in 1945. Since his death, several of Roosevelt's actions have come under substantial criticism, such as his ordering of the incarceration of Japanese Americans in concentration camps. Nonetheless, historical rankings consistently rank Roosevelt as one of the greatest presidents in American history."}]}

At small scales, physical matter exhibits properties of both particles and waves, and quantum computing leverages this behavior using specialized hardware. Classical physics cannot explain the operation of these quantum devices, and a scalable quantum computer could perform some calculations exponentially faster than any modern \"classical\" computer. In particular, a large-scale quantum computer could break widely used encryption schemes and aid physicists in performing physical simulations; however, the current state of the art is still largely experimental and impractical.\n\nThe basic unit of information in quantum computing is the qubit, similar to the bit in traditional digital electronics. Unlike a classical bit, a qubit can exist in a superposition of its two \"basis\" states, which loosely means that it is in both states simultaneously. When measuring a qubit, the result is a probabilistic output of a classical bit. If a quantum computer manipulates the qubit in a particular way, wave interference effects can amplify the desired measurement results. The design of quantum algorithms involves creating procedures that allow a quantum computer to perform calculations efficiently.\n\nPhysically engineering high-quality qubits has proven challenging. If a physical qubit is not sufficiently isolated from its environment, it suffers from quantum decoherence, introducing noise into calculations. National governments have invested heavily in experimental research that aims to develop scalable qubits with longer coherence times and lower error rates. Two of the most promising technologies are superconductors (which isolate an electrical current by eliminating electrical resistance) and ion traps (which confine a single atomic particle using electromagnetic fields).\n\nAny computational problem that can be solved by a classical computer can also be solved by a quantum computer. Conversely, any problem that can be solved by a quantum computer can also be solved by a classical computer, at least in principle given enough time. In other words, quantum computers obey the Church\u2013Turing thesis. This means that while quantum computers provide no additional advantages over classical computers in terms of computability, quantum algorithms for certain problems have significantly lower time complexities than corresponding known classical algorithms. Notably, quantum computers are believed to be able to solve certain problems quickly that no classical computer could solve in any feasible amount of time\u2014a feat known as \"quantum supremacy.\" The study of the computational complexity of problems with respect to quantum computers is known as quantum complexity theory."}]}

Fluoridated water contains fluoride at a level that is effective for preventing cavities; this can occur naturally or by adding fluoride. Fluoridated water operates on tooth surfaces: in the mouth, it creates low levels of fluoride in saliva, which reduces the rate at which tooth enamel demineralizes and increases the rate at which it remineralizes in the early stages of cavities. Typically a fluoridated compound is added to drinking water, a process that in the U.S. costs an average of about $1.17 per person-year. Defluoridation is needed when the naturally occurring fluoride level exceeds recommended limits. In 2011, the World Health Organization suggested a level of fluoride from 0.5 to 1.5 mg/L (milligrams per litre), depending on climate, local environment, and other sources of fluoride. Bottled water typically has unknown fluoride levels.\n\nTooth decay remains a major public health concern in most industrialized countries, affecting 60\u201390% of schoolchildren and the vast majority of adults. Water fluoridation reduces cavities in children, while efficacy in adults is less clear. A Cochrane review estimates a reduction in cavities when water fluoridation was used by children who had no access to other sources of fluoride to be 35% in baby teeth and 26% in permanent teeth. However, this was based on older studies which failed to control for numerous variables, such as increasing sugar consumption as well as other dental strategies. Most European countries have experienced substantial declines in tooth decay, though milk and salt fluoridation is widespread in lieu of water fluoridation. Recent studies suggest that water fluoridation, particularly in industrialized nations, may be unnecessary because topical fluorides (such as in toothpaste) are widely used, and caries rates have become low.\n\nAlthough fluoridation can cause dental fluorosis, which can alter the appearance of developing teeth or enamel fluorosis, the differences are mild and usually not an aesthetic or public health concern. There is no clear evidence of other side effects from water fluoridation. Fluoride's effects depend on the total daily intake of fluoride from all sources. Drinking water is typically the largest source; other methods of fluoride therapy include fluoridation of toothpaste, salt, and milk. The views on the most efficient method for community prevention of tooth decay are mixed. The Australian government states that water fluoridation is the most effective way to achieve fluoride exposure that is community-wide. The World Health Organization reports that water fluoridation, when feasible and culturally acceptable, has substantial advantages, especially for subgroups at high risk, while the European Commission finds no benefit to water fluoridation compared with topical use.\n\nPublic water fluoridation was first practiced in the U.S. As of 2012, 25 countries have artificial water fluoridation to varying degrees, 11 of them have more than 50% of their population drinking fluoridated water. A further 28 countries have water that is naturally fluoridated, though in many of them the fluoride is above the optimal level. As of 2012, about 435 million people worldwide received water fluoridated at the recommended level (i.e., about 5.4% of the global population).:\u200a56\u200a About 214 million of them live in the United States. Major health organizations such as the World Health Organization and FDI World Dental Federation supported water fluoridation as safe and effective. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention lists water fluoridation as one of the ten great public health achievements of the 20th century in the U.S. Despite this, the practice is controversial as a public health measure. Some countries and communities have discontinued fluoridation, while others have expanded it.

Drinking water is typically the largest source; other methods of fluoride therapy include fluoridation of toothpaste, salt, and milk. The views on the most efficient method for community prevention of tooth decay are mixed. The Australian government states that water fluoridation is the most effective way to achieve fluoride exposure that is community-wide. The World Health Organization reports that water fluoridation, when feasible and culturally acceptable, has substantial advantages, especially for subgroups at high risk, while the European Commission finds no benefit to water fluoridation compared with topical use.\n\nPublic water fluoridation was first practiced in the U.S. As of 2012, 25 countries have artificial water fluoridation to varying degrees, 11 of them have more than 50% of their population drinking fluoridated water. A further 28 countries have water that is naturally fluoridated, though in many of them the fluoride is above the optimal level. As of 2012, about 435 million people worldwide received water fluoridated at the recommended level (i.e., about 5.4% of the global population). 56\u200a About 214 million of them live in the United States. Major health organizations such as the World Health Organization and FDI World Dental Federation supported water fluoridation as safe and effective. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention lists water fluoridation as one of the ten great public health achievements of the 20th century in the U.S. Despite this, the practice is controversial as a public health measure. Some countries and communities have discontinued fluoridation, while others have expanded it. Opponents of the practice argue that neither the benefits nor the risks have been studied adequately, and debate the conflict between what might be considered mass medication and individual liberties."}]}

While it typically requires 20% down payment, you can put as little as 5% down.\n2. VA Loans: This is offered by the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs for people who have served in the military as well as their spouses. It requires no down payment and is an amazing option for anyone who is eligible.\n3. FHA Loan: A mortgage insured by the Federal Housing Administration. First time home buyers find these loans very attractive due to the small down payment requirements of just 3.5% and the flexible credit requirements. Additionally there are children products to this loan vehicle including the FHA 203k loan which can help those purchasing distressed properties by funding the renovations, within certain predetermined guidelines.\n4. Adjustable-Rate Mortgage (ARM): With this product, your interest rate varies over time depending on market and economic conditions. These seem attractive initially as they typically start with lower rates than fixed-rate mortgages but can increase over time.\n5. Fixed-Rate Mortgages: This interest rate is locked in at the start of the loan and starts the same throughout the entire term.\n7. USDA Loan: Guaranteed by the U.S. Department of Agriculture and eligible to suburban and rural homebuyers. This loan product also doesn't require down payment and has lower mortgage insurance requirements than an FHA loan\n\nWhile these are the most common loan types, other options tend to appear from time to time. It is important to do your research and pick the product that best suits your individual needs and long-term financial goals. To help better understand these options many aspiring buyers reach out to local loan providers, real estate agents, and brokers."}]}

Further NATO air strikes helped bring the Yugoslav Wars to an end, resulting in the Dayton Agreement in November 1995. As part of this agreement, NATO deployed a UN-mandated peacekeeping force, under Operation Joint Endeavor, named IFOR. Almost 60,000 NATO troops were joined by forces from non-NATO countries in this peacekeeping mission. This transitioned into the smaller SFOR, which started with 32,000 troops initially and ran from December 1996 until December 2004, when operations were then passed onto the European Union Force Althea.

Dubbed the \"King of Pop\", he is regarded as one of the most significant cultural figures of the 20th century. Over a four-decade career, his contributions to music, dance, and fashion, along with his publicized personal life, made him a global figure in popular culture. Jackson influenced artists across many music genres; through stage and video performances, he popularized complicated dance moves such as the moonwalk, to which he gave the name, as well as the robot.\nThe eighth child of the Jackson family, Jackson made his public debut in 1964 with his older brothers Jackie, Tito, Jermaine, and Marlon as a member of the Jackson 5 (later known as the Jacksons). Jackson began his solo career in 1971 while at Motown Records. He became a solo star with his 1979 album Off the Wall. His music videos, including those for \"Beat It\", \"Billie Jean\", and \"Thriller\" from his 1982 album Thriller, are credited with breaking racial barriers and transforming the medium into an artform and promotional tool. He helped propel the success of MTV and continued to innovate with videos for the albums Bad (1987), Dangerous (1991), HIStory: Past, Present and Future, Book I (1995), and Invincible (2001). Thriller became the best-selling album of all time, while Bad was the first album to produce five US Billboard Hot 100 number-one singles.\nFrom the late 1980s, Jackson became a figure of controversy and speculation due to his changing appearance, relationships, behavior, and lifestyle. In 1993, he was accused of sexually abusing the child of a family friend. The lawsuit was settled out of civil court; Jackson was not indicted due to lack of evidence. In 2005, he was tried and acquitted of further child sexual abuse allegations and several other charges. The FBI found no evidence of criminal conduct by Jackson in either case. In 2009, while he was preparing for a series of comeback concerts, This Is It, Jackson died from an overdose of propofol administered by his personal physician, Conrad Murray, who was convicted in 2011 of involuntary manslaughter. His death triggered reactions around the world, creating unprecedented surges of Internet traffic and a spike in sales of his music. A televised memorial service for Jackson, held at the Staples Center in Los Angeles, was viewed by more than an estimated 2.5 billion people globally.\nJackson is one of the best-selling music artists of all time, with estimated sales of over 400 million records worldwide.\n\nHe had 13 Billboard Hot 100 number-one singles (third highest of any artist in the Hot 100 era) and was the first artist to have a top-ten single in the Billboard Hot 100 in five different decades. His honors include 15 Grammy Awards, 6 Brit Awards, a Golden Globe Award, and 39 Guinness World Records, including the \"Most Successful Entertainer of All Time\". Jackson's inductions include the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame (twice), the Vocal Group Hall of Fame, the Songwriters Hall of Fame, the Dance Hall of Fame (the only recording artist to be inducted), and the Rhythm and Blues Music Hall of Fame."}]}

Java is the fifth most commonly used programming language according to Stack Overflow. Java is generally faster and more efficient than Python because it is a compiled language. While it's one of the coding languages considered to be easy to learn because many of the processes of this high-level language run automatically. However, Python still takes the cake in terms of simplicity. \n\n As an interpreted language, Python has simpler, more concise syntax than Java. It can perform the same function as Java in fewer lines of code. Python also offers extensive libraries, especially around data analysis and machine learning. Because it's dynamically typed, it allows for even fast development compared to Java. \n\nOther key differences include how each handles memory management and the ability to run multiple threads at the same time. \n\nFor example, lets dive into this threading difference. Java fully supports multithreading. When you use Java, you can run more than one thread at a time. When running multiple threads, they share a common memory area to increase efficiency and performance. Now if you search the web for threading in Python you might be a bit confused. You will find articles claiming that Python can't support multithreading but then you will also find tutorials and packages for threading and parallel processing. Python has a Global Interpreter Lock that only lets one thread execute at a time, so if you're working on a multi-threaded CPU-bound program, it'll likely be even slower. However, it's threading package allows you to speed up I/O bound programs. Using multiprocessing programs instead of multithreaded programs can be an effective workaround.\n\nThe answer to which is better is largely dependent on the user and the use case. Before learning one or starting a new project with either, think about what your goals are and decide which one fits those more closely."}]}

For instance, in the United States between 1973 and 1999, September 16 is the most common birthday and December 25 the least common birthday. Some other uncommon birthdays in the West are January 1, December 24, and April 1.\n\nThe least common birthday is usually a holiday when most people take time off work. There are multiple reasons why these days have fewer births, but one reason is that doctors are less likely to schedule cesarean births on such days. April 1 is an exception, and is likely because parents who are able to choose not to give birth on that day, to prevent their children from being bullied for having their birthday on April Fool's Day.\n\nThis question is harder to answer in many non-Western countries as there is less easily accessible data. For example in a survey of students in India between 2007 and 2012, the statistics show much more births just before school opens, and on round days like the 5th, 10th, 15th, and 20th.

In 1994, the diagnosis of Asperger's was included in the fourth edition (DSM-IV) of the American Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders; however, with the publication of DSM-5 in 2013, the syndrome was removed, and the symptoms are now included within autism spectrum disorder along with classic autism and pervasive developmental disorder not otherwise specified (PDD-NOS). It was similarly merged into autism spectrum disorder in the International Classification of Diseases (ICD-11) as of 2021.\n\nThe exact cause of Asperger's is poorly understood. While it has high heritability, the underlying genetics have not been determined conclusively. Environmental factors are also believed to play a role. Brain imaging has not identified a common underlying condition. There is no single treatment, and the UK's National Health Service (NHS) guidelines suggest that \u2019treatment\u2019 of any form of autism should not be a goal since autism is not an 'a disease that can be removed or cured\u2019. According to the Royal College of Psychiatrists, while co-occurring conditions might require treatment, \u2019management of autism itself is chiefly about providing the education, training and social support/care required to improve the person's ability to function in the everyday world\u2019. Only limited data support the effectiveness of particular interventions for autism. Interventions may include social skills training, cognitive behavioral therapy, physical therapy, speech therapy, parent training, and medications for associated problems, such as mood or anxiety. Autistic characteristics tend to become less evident in adulthood , but social and communication difficulties usually persist."}]}

Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\n\n### Instruction:\nGiven these paragraphs about Asperger Multiomics, what is the goal in combining all the \"omes\"?\n\n### Input:\nMultiomics, multi-omics, integrative omics, \"panomics\" or \"pan-omics\" is a biological analysis approach in which the data sets are multiple \"omes\", such as the genome, proteome, transcriptome, epigenome, metabolome, and microbiome (i.e., a meta-genome and/or meta-transcriptome, depending upon how it is sequenced); in other words, the use of multiple omics technologies to study life in a concerted way. By combining these \"omes\", scientists can analyze complex biological big data to find novel associations between biological entities, pinpoint relevant biomarkers and build elaborate markers of disease and physiology. In doing so, multiomics integrates diverse omics data to find a coherently matching geno-pheno-envirotype relationship or association. The OmicTools service lists more than 99 softwares related to multiomic data analysis, as well as more than 99 databases on the topic.\n\nSystems biology approaches are often based upon the use of panomic analysis data. The American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO) defines panomics as referring to \"the interaction of all biological functions within a cell and with other body functions, combining data collected by targeted tests ... and global assays (such as genome sequencing) with other patient-specific information.\"\n\nSingle-cell multiomics\nA branch of the field of multiomics is the analysis of multilevel single-cell data, called single-cell multiomics. This approach gives us an unprecedent resolution to look at multilevel transitions in health and disease at the single cell level. An advantage in relation to bulk analysis is to mitigate confounding factors derived from cell to cell variation, allowing the uncovering of heterogeneous tissue architectures.\n\nMethods for parallel single-cell genomic and transcriptomic analysis can be based on simultaneous amplification or physical separation of RNA and genomic DNA. They allow insights that cannot be gathered solely from transcriptomic analysis, as RNA data do not contain non-coding genomic regions and information regarding copy-number variation, for example. An extension of this methodology is the integration of single-cell transcriptomes to single-cell methylomes, combining single-cell bisulfite sequencing to single cell RNA-Seq. Other techniques to query the epigenome, as single-cell ATAC-Seq and single-cell Hi-C also exist.\n\nA different, but related, challenge is the integration of proteomic and transcriptomic data. One approach to perform such measurement is to physically separate single-cell lysates in two, processing half for RNA, and half for proteins. The protein content of lysates can be measured by proximity extension assays (PEA), for example, which use DNA-barcoded antibodies. A different approach uses a combination of heavy-metal RNA probes and protein antibodies to adapt mass cytometry for multiomic analysis.\n\nMultiomics and machine learning\nIn parallel to the advances in highthroughput biology, machine learning applications to biomedical data analysis are flourishing. The integration of multi-omics data analysis and machine learning has led to the discovery of new biomarkers. For example, one of the methods of the mixOmics project implements a method based on sparse Partial Least Squares regression for selection of features (putative biomarkers).\n\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multiomics\n\n### Response:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "By combining these \"omes\", scientists can analyze complex biological big data to find novel associations between biological entities, pinpoint relevant biomarkers and build elaborate markers of disease and physiology.

As the largest optical telescope in space, it is equipped with high-resolution and high-sensitivity instruments, allowing it to view objects too old, distant, or faint for the Hubble Space Telescope. This enables investigations across many fields of astronomy and cosmology, such as observation of the first stars, the formation of the first galaxies, and detailed atmospheric characterization of potentially habitable exoplanets.\n\nThe U.S. National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) led JWST's design and development and partnered with two main agencies: the European Space Agency (ESA) and the Canadian Space Agency (CSA). The NASA Goddard Space Flight Center (GSFC) in Maryland managed telescope development, while the Space Telescope Science Institute in Baltimore on the Homewood Campus of Johns Hopkins University currently operates JWST. The primary contractor for the project was Northrop Grumman. The telescope is named after James E. Webb, who was the administrator of NASA from 1961 to 1968 during the Mercury, Gemini, and Apollo programs.\n\nThe James Webb Space Telescope was launched on 25 December 2021 on an Ariane 5 rocket from Kourou, French Guiana, and arrived at the Sun\u2013Earth L2 Lagrange point in January 2022. The first JWST image was released to the public via a press conference on 11 July 2022.\n\nJWST's primary mirror consists of 18 hexagonal mirror segments made of gold-plated beryllium, which combined create a 6.5-meter-diameter (21 ft) mirror, compared with Hubble's 2.4 m (7 ft 10 in). This gives JWST a light-collecting area of about 25 square meters, about six times that of Hubble. Unlike Hubble, which observes in the near ultraviolet and visible (0.1 to 0.8 \u03bcm), and near infrared (0.8\u20132.5 \u03bcm) spectra, JWST observes a lower frequency range, from long-wavelength visible light (red) through mid-infrared (0.6\u201328.3 \u03bcm). The telescope must be kept extremely cold, below 50 K (\u2212223 \u00b0C; \u2212370 \u00b0F), such that the infrared light emitted by the telescope itself does not interfere with the collected light. It is deployed in a solar orbit near the Sun\u2013Earth L2 Lagrange point, about 1.5 million kilometers (930,000 mi) from Earth, where its five-layer sunshield protects it from warming by the Sun, Earth, and Moon.\n\nInitial designs for the telescope, then named the Next Generation Space Telescope, began in 1996. Two concept studies were commissioned in 1999, for a potential launch in 2007 and a US$1 billion budget. The program was plagued with enormous cost overruns and delays; a major redesign in 2005 led to the current approach, with construction completed in 2016 at a total cost of US$10 billion. The high-stakes nature of the launch and the telescope's complexity were remarked upon by the media, scientists, and engineers.\n\n"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "The James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) is a space telescope and the successor of the famous Hubble Space Telescope.

However, there is debate as to whether he believed in multiple worlds, and if he did, whether those worlds were co-existent or successive. The first to whom we can definitively attribute the concept of innumerable worlds are the Ancient Greek Atomists, beginning with Leucippus and Democritus in the 5th century BCE, followed by Epicurus (341-270 BCE) and Lucretius (1st century BCE). In the third century BCE, the philosopher Chrysippus suggested that the world eternally expired and regenerated, effectively suggesting the existence of multiple universes across time. The concept of multiple universes became more defined in the Middle Ages. The American philosopher and psychologist William James used the term \"multiverse\" in 1895, but in a different context. The concept first appeared in the modern scientific context in the course of the debate between Boltzmann and Zermelo in 1895. In Dublin in 1952, Erwin Schr\u00f6dinger gave a lecture in which he jocularly warned his audience that what he was about to say might \"seem lunatic\".

The decision has been widely criticized, with some scholars describing it as \"an odious and discredited artifact of popular bigotry\", and as \"a stain on American jurisprudence\". The case is often cited as one of the worst Supreme Court decisions of all time. Chief Justice John Roberts repudiated the Korematsu decision in his majority opinion in the 2018 case of Trump v.

Roosevelt had issued Executive Order 9066 on February 19, 1942, authorizing the U.S. War Department to create military areas from which any or all Americans might be excluded. Subsequently, the Western Defense Command, a U.S. Army military command charged with coordinating the defense of the West Coast of the United States, ordered \"all persons of Japanese ancestry, including aliens and non-aliens\" to relocate to internment camps.

Because of the extremely short 0.7 ms half-life of its only known isotope, its chemistry has not yet been investigated.\nFor the first six periods of the periodic table, the noble gases are exactly the members of group 18. Noble gases are typically highly unreactive except when under particular extreme conditions. The inertness of noble gases makes them very suitable in applications where reactions are not wanted. For example, argon is used in incandescent lamps to prevent the hot tungsten filament from oxidizing; also, helium is used in breathing gas by deep-sea divers to prevent oxygen, nitrogen and carbon dioxide toxicity.\nThe properties of the noble gases can be well explained by modern theories of atomic structure: Their outer shell of valence electrons is considered to be \"full\", giving them little tendency to participate in chemical reactions, and it has been possible to prepare only a few hundred noble gas compounds. The melting and boiling points for a given noble gas are close together, differing by less than 10 \u00b0C (18 \u00b0F); that is, they are liquids over only a small temperature range.\nNeon, argon, krypton, and xenon are obtained from air in an air separation unit using the methods of liquefaction of gases and fractional distillation. Helium is sourced from natural gas fields that have high concentrations of helium in the natural gas, using cryogenic gas separation techniques, and radon is usually isolated from the radioactive decay of dissolved radium, thorium, or uranium compounds. Noble gases have several important applications in industries such as lighting, welding, and space exploration. A helium-oxygen breathing gas is often used by deep-sea divers at depths of seawater over 55 m (180 ft). After the risks caused by the flammability of hydrogen became apparent in the Hindenburg disaster, it was replaced with helium in blimps and balloons.\n\n"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Neon, argon, krypton, and xenon are obtained from air in an air separation unit using the methods of liquefaction of gases and fractional distillation.

Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\n\n### Instruction:\nWhy are there so few works of Kafka left even though he was a prolific writer?\n\n### Input:\nFranz Kafka (3 July 1883 \u2013 3 June 1924) was a German-speaking Bohemian novelist and short-story writer based in Prague, who is widely regarded as one of the major figures of 20th-century literature. His work fuses elements of realism and the fantastic. It typically features isolated protagonists facing bizarre or surrealistic predicaments and incomprehensible socio-bureaucratic powers. It has been interpreted as exploring themes of alienation, existential anxiety, guilt, and absurdity. His best known works include the short story \"The Metamorphosis\" and novels The Trial and The Castle. The term Kafkaesque has entered English to describe absurd situations, like those depicted in his writing.\n\nKafka was born into a middle-class German-speaking Czech Jewish family in Prague, the capital of the Kingdom of Bohemia, then part of the Austro-Hungarian Empire (today the capital of the Czech Republic). He trained as a lawyer, and after completing his legal education was employed full-time by an insurance company, forcing him to relegate writing to his spare time. Over the course of his life, Kafka wrote hundreds of letters to family and close friends, including his father, with whom he had a strained and formal relationship. He became engaged to several women but never married. He died in obscurity in 1924 at the age of 40 from tuberculosis.\n\nKafka was a prolific writer, spending most of his free time writing, often late in the night. He burned an estimated 90 per cent of his total work due to his persistent struggles with self-doubt. Much of the remaining 10 per cent is lost or otherwise unpublished. Few of Kafka's works were published during his lifetime: the story collections Contemplation and A Country Doctor, and individual stories (such as \"The Metamorphosis\") were published in literary magazines but received little public attention.\n\nIn his will, Kafka instructed his close friend and literary executor Max Brod to destroy his unfinished works, including his novels The Trial, The Castle, and Amerika, but Brod ignored these instructions, and had much of his work published. Kafka's work became famous in German-speaking countries after World War II, influencing their literature, and it spread elsewhere in the world in the 1960s. It has since influenced a range of writers, critics, artists, and philosophers.\n\n### Response:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Though Kafka was a prolific writer he struggled with low self-esteem and destroyed 90% of his work.

The United States Congress has honored her as \"the first lady of civil rights\" and \"the mother of the freedom movement\". Parks became a NAACP activist in 1943, participating in several high profile civil rights campaigns. On December 1, 1955, in Montgomery, Alabama, Parks rejected bus driver James F. Blake's order to vacate a row of four seats in the \"colored\" section in favor of a White passenger, once the \"White\" section was filled. Parks was not the first person to resist bus segregation, but the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP) believed that she was the best candidate for seeing through a court challenge after her arrest for civil disobedience in violating Alabama segregation laws, and she helped inspire the Black community to boycott the Montgomery buses for over a year. The case became bogged down in the state courts, but the federal Montgomery bus lawsuit Browder v. Gayle resulted in a November 1956 decision that bus segregation is unconstitutional under the Equal Protection Clause of the 14th Amendment to the U.S. Constitution.\n\nParks's act of defiance and the Montgomery bus boycott became important symbols of the movement. She became an international icon of resistance to racial segregation, and organized and collaborated with civil rights leaders, including Edgar Nixon and Martin Luther King Jr. At the time, Parks was employed as a seamstress at a local department store and was secretary of the Montgomery chapter of the NAACP. She had recently attended the Highlander Folk School, a Tennessee center for training activists for workers' rights and racial equality. Although widely honored in later years, she also suffered for her act; she was fired from her job, and received death threats for years afterwards. Shortly after the boycott, she moved to Detroit, where she briefly found similar work. From 1965 to 1988, she served as secretary and receptionist to John Conyers, an African-American US Representative. She was also active in the Black Power movement and the support of political prisoners in the US.\n\nAfter retirement, Parks wrote her autobiography and continued to insist that there was more work to be done in the struggle for justice. Parks received national recognition, including the NAACP's 1979 Spingarn Medal, the Presidential Medal of Freedom, the Congressional Gold Medal, and a posthumous statue in the United States Capitol's National Statuary Hall.

It was another 123 years before it reached two billion in 1927, but it took only 33 years to reach three billion in 1960. Thereafter, it took 14 years for the global population to reach four billion in 1974, 13 years to reach five billion in 1987, 12 years to reach six billion in 1999 and, according to the United States Census Bureau, 13 years to reach seven billion in March 2012. The United Nations, however, estimated that the world population reached seven billion in October 2011.\n\nAccording to the UN, the global population reached eight billion in November 2022, but because the growth rate is slowing, it will take another 15 years to reach around 9 billion by 2037 and 20 years to reach 10 billion by 2057. Alternative scenarios for 2050 range from a low of 7.4 billion to a high of more than 10.6 billion. Projected figures vary depending on underlying statistical assumptions and the variables used in projection calculations, especially the fertility and mortality variables. Long-range predictions to 2150 range from a population decline to 3.2 billion in the \"low scenario\", to \"high scenarios\" of 24.8 billion. One extreme scenario predicted a massive increase to 256 billion by 2150, assuming the global fertility rate remained at its 1995 level of 3.04 children per woman; however, by 2010 the global fertility rate had declined to 2.52.\n\nThere is no estimation for the exact day or month the world's population surpassed one or two billion. The points at which it reached three and four billion were not officially noted, but the International Database of the United States Census Bureau placed them in July 1959 and April 1974 respectively. The United Nations did determine, and commemorate, the \"Day of 5 Billion\" on 11 July 1987, and the \"Day of 6 Billion\" on 12 October 1999.

Impacts can now be observed on all continents and ocean regions, with low-latitude, less developed areas facing the greatest risk. Continued warming has potentially \u201csevere, pervasive and irreversible impacts\u201d for people and ecosystems. The risks are unevenly distributed, but are generally greater for disadvantaged people in developing and developed countries.\n\nThe WHO has classified climate change as the greatest threat to global health in the 21st century. Extreme weather leads to injury and loss of life, and crop failures to undernutrition. Various infectious diseases are more easily transmitted in a warmer climate, such as dengue fever and malaria. Young children are the most vulnerable to food shortages. Both children and older people are vulnerable to extreme heat. The World Health Organization (WHO) has estimated that between 2030 and 2050, climate change would cause around 250,000 additional deaths per year. They assessed deaths from heat exposure in elderly people, increases in diarrhea, malaria, dengue, coastal flooding, and childhood undernutrition. Over 500,000 more adult deaths are projected yearly by 2050 due to reductions in food availability and quality. By 2100, 50% to 75% of the global population may face climate conditions that are life-threatening due to combined effects of extreme heat and humidity.\n\nClimate change is affecting food security. It has caused reduction in global yields of maize, wheat, and soybeans between 1981 and 2010. Future warming could further reduce global yields of major crops. Crop production will probably be negatively affected in low-latitude countries, while effects at northern latitudes may be positive or negative. Up to an additional 183 million people worldwide, particularly those with lower incomes, are at risk of hunger as a consequence of these impacts. Climate change also impacts fish populations. Globally, less will be available to be fished. Regions dependent on glacier water, regions that are already dry, and small islands have a higher risk of water stress due to climate change.\n\nEconomic damages due to climate change may be severe and there is a chance of disastrous consequences. Climate change has likely already increased global economic inequality, and this trend is projected to continue. Most of the severe impacts are expected in sub-Saharan Africa, where most of the local inhabitants are dependent upon natural and agricultural resources and South-East Asia. The World Bank estimates that climate change could drive over 120 million people into poverty by 2030.\n\nCurrent inequalities based on wealth and social status have worsened due to climate change. Major difficulties in mitigating, adapting, and recovering to climate shocks are faced by marginalized people who have less control over resources. Indigenous people, who are subsistent on their land and ecosystems, will face endangerment to their wellness and lifestyles due to climate change. An expert elicitation concluded that the role of climate change in armed conflict has been small compared to factors such as socio-economic inequality and state capabilities.\n\nLow-lying islands and coastal communities are threatened by sea level rise, which makes flooding more common. Sometimes, land is permanently lost to the sea. This could lead to statelessness for people in island nations, such as the Maldives and Tuvalu. In some regions, the rise in temperature and humidity may be too severe for humans to adapt to. With worst-case climate change, models project that almost one-third of humanity might live in extremely hot and uninhabitable climates, similar to the current climate found in the Sahara. These factors can drive environmental migration, both within and between countries. More people are expected to be displaced because of sea level rise, extreme weather and conflict from increased competition over natural resources. Climate change may also increase vulnerability, leading to \"trapped populations\" who are not able to move due to a lack of resources.\n\n"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "- Major threat to global health due to extreme weather, crop shortages, and increases in infectious diseases (more easily transmitted in warmer weather)\n\n- Effects to food security due to crop yield reduction and impacts to fish population\n\n- Economic damages from adverse weather events and dislocations on natural and agricultural resources\n\n- Increases in wealth and socioeconomic inequalities as climate change impacts marginalized populations who depend on land and associated ecosystems"}]}

The creamy texture can help mimic the egg\u2019s soft texture in your breakfast meals and desserts.\nUnsweetened applesauce - You can use a quarter cup of unsweetened applesauce for one egg. It adds moisture and sweetness to what you are making. The natural fruit pectin also helps bind the ingredients. It can be dense than an egg in your baking so you may need to use a teaspoon of baking powder to encourage fluffiness. \nMashed banana - This has a very distinct flavor, so only use it in recipes when you think the banana flavor will complement what you are making. This works well in pancakes, brownies, and banana bread. You can use a ripe medium mashed banana for every large egg. The starches and sugars in the banana help develop a beautiful golden brown crust. \nAquafaba - This is an ideal substitute for egg whites, giving your dessert structure. Take three tablespoons of liquid from inside your can of chickpeas and whip them to a fluffy consistency. \nFlaxseeds or Chia Seeds - This is best for recipes that don\u2019t require too many eggs. Combine one tablespoon of seeds with three tablespoons of water for every large egg. Let it sit for 20 minutes to get a slimy mixture that mimics and egg.\nBaking Soda and Vinegar - Mix a teaspoon of baking soda and a tablespoon of white vinegar together to help create the air bubbles needed in things like pancakes, cookies, and quick breads.

The Boca Raton Army Airfield was the only airborne radar training facility during the war.  Military planes from across the United States would have to come to this base if they wanted the radar technology to be installed.  The location of this base made it optimal to maintain secrecy as it was very rural and largely uninhabited still, providing access to thousands of acres of unused land.  The base was also just a few short miles from the Atlantic Ocean, making it the perfect place to stealthily fly and practice using the radar technology.

He is best known for his hit single \"She's All I Got\" and for being one of the inaugural artists signed to Clive Davis' J Records label.\n\nBiography\nThe son of Guyanese American jazz saxophonist Jimmy Cozier, and Dawn Cozier, a Jamaican born hair stylist. Cozier and his younger brother Malik were raised in Crown Heights, Brooklyn. Cozier was encouraged to sing as a child by his family, who would demand that he perform in group settings. He started out as a singer/songwriter for artists such as M\u00fda, Sin\u00e9ad O'Connor, and Janet Jackson (whose hit \"Girlfriend/Boyfriend\" he co-wrote). He was a background vocalist for the Junior Mafia/Lil' Kim track \"Backstabbers\" and toured with Joe behind the latter's album All That I Am.\n\nWyclef Jean caught word of Cozier's talent thru Cozier manager Jacques \u201cHaitian Jack\u201d Agnant and had him meet with Clive Davis, who signed Cozier to J Records in 2000. His debut single \"She's All I Got\" was released in 2001, and rose to #26 on the Billboard Hot 100 and to #4 on the R&B chart.\n\nFollowing the success of the single, his self-titled debut album was released on July 9, 2001 and hit the Billboard Top 200 at #65 and #15 on the R&B Albums chart.

For kids above 10 and adults, Lego Technic and Icons are super cool and good for display. \n\nFor people interested in specific themes, like Star War, Harry Potter, etc, lego also has sets in those themes for you to choose from."}]}

It was edited and published posthumously by his son Christopher Tolkien in 1977, assisted by the fantasy author Guy Gavriel Kay.[T 2] It tells of E\u00e4, a fictional universe that includes the Blessed Realm of Valinor, the once-great region of Beleriand, the sunken island of N\u00famenor, and the continent of Middle-earth, where Tolkien's most popular works\u2014The Hobbit and The Lord of the Rings\u2014are set. After the success of The Hobbit, Tolkien's publisher Stanley Unwin requested a sequel, and Tolkien offered a draft of the writings that would later become The Silmarillion. Unwin rejected this proposal, calling the draft obscure and \"too Celtic\", so Tolkien began working on a new story that eventually became The Lord of the Rings.\n"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "The Silmarillion (Quenya: [silma\u02c8rilli\u0254n]) is a collection of myths[T 1] and stories in varying styles by the English writer J.

Unwin rejected this proposal, calling the draft obscure and \"too Celtic\", so Tolkien began working on a new story that eventually became The Lord of the Rings.\n\nThe Silmarillion has five parts. The first, Ainulindal\u00eb, tells in mythic style of the creation of E\u00e4, the \"world that is.\" The second part, Valaquenta, gives a description of the Valar and Maiar, supernatural powers of E\u00e4. The next section, Quenta Silmarillion, which forms the bulk of the collection, chronicles the history of the events before and during the First Age, including the wars over three jewels, the Silmarils, that gave the book its title. The fourth part, Akallab\u00eath, relates the history of the Downfall of N\u00famenor and its people, which takes place in the Second Age. The final part, Of the Rings of Power and the Third Age, is a brief summary of the events of The Lord of the Rings and those that led to them.\n\nThe book shows the influence of many sources, including the Finnish epic Kalevala, Greek mythology in the lost island of Atlantis (as N\u00famenor) and the Olympian gods (in the shape of the Valar, though these also resemble the Norse \u00c6sir).\n\nBecause J. R. R. Tolkien died leaving his legendarium unedited, Christopher Tolkien selected and edited materials to tell the story from start to end. In a few cases, this meant that he had to devise completely new material, within the tenor of his father's thought, to resolve gaps and inconsistencies in the narrative, particularly Chapter 22, \"Of the Ruin of Doriath\".\n\nThe Silmarillion received a generally poor reception on publication. Scholars found the work problematic, not least because the book is a construction, not authorised by Tolkien himself, from the large corpus of documents and drafts also called \"The Silmarillion\". Scholars have noted that Tolkien intended the work to be a mythology, penned by many hands, and redacted by a fictional editor, whether \u00c6lfwine or Bilbo Baggins. As such, the scholar Gergely Nagy considers that the fact that the work has indeed been edited actually realises Tolkien's intention."}]}

{"dataset": "alpagasus_3k_dolly", "id": "alpagasus_3k_2959", "messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Based on the text, what are the best ways for people to eat fruits?\n\nIn the US, we are fortunate to have a dizzying array of fruits that fill our grocery stores year-round. They come in all sizes, shapes, and colors, and we have all heard about the recommended five servings of fruits and vegetables a day. So, what are we eating them for? And how does the nutritional value vary between fruits? Is there any difference between whole fruits versus juice, fresh versus dried? Let\u2019s take a look.\n\nDifferences between fruits\nJust like other foods, different fruits have different nutrient values. Generally, whole fruits are good sources of fiber while fruit juices are not. And one cup of fruit juice, even 100% fruit juice, has a lot more sugar than one piece or one serving of whole fruit. In addition, whole fruits are more satiating than juices. When meeting the recommended fruit and vegetable intake, it is better to eat them (whole) than drink them (juice). However, one should not completely avoid drinking juice \u2014 if it is 100% juice \u2014 but you should limit consumption to no more than 4 to 8 ounces a day.\n\nThe freezer section of the grocery store is often stocked with quite a variety of frozen fruits. These are often peeled and cut already (like mango), which is convenient and often less expensive than fresh fruits. Frozen fruits are usually picked and quick-frozen near the point of harvest, therefore the nutrients are well preserved. Moreover, some seasonal fruits such as blueberries are readily available in frozen form. The key to selection is to choose plain frozen fruits without added sugar.\n\nThere are a number of fruits that are available in dried form, such as raisins, apricots, and pineapple \u2014 just to name a few. They also have good nutrient values, keep for a long time, are convenient to carry around, and are high in calories, making them a favorite for hikers and campers. However, some often have sugar added in the drying process, particularly mango and pineapple. Dried cranberries almost always have sugar added, as they are naturally very tart. Even for those without added sugar, the compact volume and sweetness make it quite easy to eat a lot in one sitting, and the calories can add up quickly.\n\nSome dried fruits like raisins and apricots are also treated with sulfur dioxide to preserve freshness and color. For most people that is not a concern; however, some individuals are sensitive, especially those with asthma. Sulfur dioxide treatment is labeled on the package, so it is not difficult to avoid if necessary.\n\nWhat about buying organic?\nWe have much choice when it comes to organic and conventionally grown fruits, be they fresh, frozen, or dried. Nutritionally, there is not enough difference to choose one over the other, though consumers might choose one over another based on farming practices and environmental impact. The US has regulations on pesticide use, but some fruits tend to have more residual pesticides than others, and it is always recommended that you wash fruits thoroughly before eating.\n\nDifferences in nutritional value\nDifferent fruits are good sources of different nutrients. Citrus fruits are high in vitamin C, and other fruits are good sources of nutrients too. A few examples below:\n\nNutrient: Major functions - Good fruit sources\n\npotassium: fluid and electrolyte balance, maintaining healthy blood pressure - oranges, raspberries, bananas, cherries, pomegranates, honeydew melons, avocados\n\niron: formation of red blood cells, brain growth in children - dried apricots, raisins\n\nvitamin C: maintaining healthy immune system, wound healing, antioxidant - citrus fruits, strawberries, kiwi\n\nfolate: DNA synthesis, formation of red blood cells, early neural tube development in the fetus - oranges, mangos, avocados\n\nvitamin A: night vision, cell growth, immune function - cantaloupe\n\nBesides the above nutrients, certain fruits are also high in flavonoids. This is a diverse group of compounds, some of which are potent antioxidants that protect against oxidative damage, and may reduce the risk of certain diseases such as cardiovascular disease and diabetes. In particular, citrus fruits are high in the flavanones class of flavonoids, and blackberries, blueberries, cranberries, and cherries are high in the anthocyanidins class of flavonoids.\n\nSo, what fruits should we eat?\nAs you can see, there isn\u2019t one fruit that has all the nutrients, so eating a variety is the key to good health. Try something new! Most adults should eat a variety of colors for about 2 cups a day. Prioritize whole fruits over juice. Eat what is in season, as it will be cheaper. And enjoy your fruits: eat mindfully to fully appreciate the smell, texture, and flavor. Bon appetit!\n\n"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "- Eat whole fruits instead of drinking 100% fruit juice, event 100% fruit juice, because whole fruits contain a lot more fiber and less super\n- Eat fruits of the season.

In 1955, a second Dick's was opened in Seattle's Capitol Hill district. This was followed by a third in 1960 in the Crown Hill neighborhood, a 4th in 1963 in Lake City, a fifth in Queen Anne in 1974. All but the Queen Anne location are without customer seating. The Queen Anne location has indoor tables and no drive-in.\n\nThe simple menu has changed little over time. It features fast-food staples such as hamburgers, hand-cut french fries, and individually made milkshakes. Dick's is particularly well known for the \"Dick's Deluxe,\" which includes lettuce, mayonnaise, and chopped pickles. No substitutions are allowed and all burgers are cooked to well done. For most of Dick's history, the only available omissions were the Deluxe without cheese or fries without salt.

After a few weeks of polling, the area north of Seattle won the right for a new Dick's Drive-In. On October 15, 2010, Dick's officials announced the new location to be in Edmonds on the corner of Hwy 99 and 220th St. On October 20, 2011, the 6th location in Edmonds opened to the public. The opening occurred multiple weeks ahead of schedule.\n\nIn 2017, Dick's launched another poll to determine its seventh location, which would be located either on the Eastside or in South King County. Over 177,000 participants cast their votes, with the majority favoring the South region. Locations being considered included Kent, West Seattle, South Seattle, Renton, Burien, SeaTac, Tukwila, Auburn, Normandy Park, Des Moines and Federal Way. After an extensive amount of time, it was announced on September 7, 2017, that the 7th location to the chain would be located in Kent on Highway 99, 5 miles (8 km) south of Sea-Tac Airport. The location opened on December 12, 2018.\n\nIn September 2020, Dick's announced that it would launch a food truck to serve five locations in Western Washington that were chosen through a public poll: Bellevue, Bellingham, Everett, Renton, and West Seattle.

By the mid 17th century, it had reached India and the East Indies. Coffee houses would establish themselves in Western Europe by the late 17th century, especially in England and Germany. One of the earliest cultivations of coffee in the New World was when Gabriel de Clieu brought coffee seedlings to Martinique in 1720. These beans later sprouted 18,680 coffee trees which enabled its spread to other Caribbean islands like Saint-Domingue and also to Mexico. By 1788, Saint-Domingue supplied half the world's coffee. By 1852, globally, Brazil became the largest producer of coffee and has held that status ever since. The period since 1950 saw the widening of the playing field due to the emergence of several other major producers, notably Colombia, Ivory Coast, Ethiopia, and Vietnam; the latter overtook Colombia and became the second-largest producer in 1999. Modern production techniques along with the mass productization of coffee has made it a household item today.\n\nOutput:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Much of the early history\u00a0of coffee was tied to oral tradition in modern-day Ethiopia.
